"""Render a publication-quality data figure from a JSON spec.

    python chart_gen.py --spec fig.json --out figures/fig1
    cat fig.json | python chart_gen.py --spec - --out figures/fig1

Writes ``<out>.pdf`` (the deliverable — vector, so LaTeX renders the text at
page resolution) and ``<out>.png`` (raster, for reading the figure back to
check it). ``--format`` narrows that if only one is wanted.

**Why a spec instead of generated plotting code:** the figure is then a
function of the data. A model that writes matplotlib by hand can produce a
chart whose bars do not match the numbers it was given, and nothing catches
it — the code runs, the picture looks plausible. Here the numbers ARE the
input, the axes are computed from them, and fits (regression, power law) are
derived from the plotted points rather than accepted alongside them, so a
figure cannot disagree with its own data.

Every chart type in ``chart_renderers.RENDERERS`` is available, plus
``panel`` which composes any of them into a labelled grid.

Run ``--list-types`` for the catalogue, ``--example TYPE`` for a complete
runnable spec of that type.

    # Every byte to a ``.part`` file FIRST, then rename them into place. The
    # rendering above is already staged in memory for the same reason — but
    # the writes were not, so a spec asking for pdf,png whose PNG write failed
    # left the PDF on disk and exited 2. Measured: 6845 bytes of fig.pdf beside
    # a missing fig.png. SKILL.md promises "Nothing partial is ever written — a
    # half-file would pass the downstream existence check", and the downstream
    # check is exactly `does fig.pdf exist`, so it read that failure as success.
    #
    # Rename rather than delete-on-failure: re-rendering over an existing
    # figure must not destroy the previous one when the new render cannot be
    # written. A failed run now leaves whatever was there before, untouched.
    # The renames are not atomic AS A GROUP, so every target is checked before
    # the first one happens. Writing the parts and renaming as we went still
    # left fig.pdf behind when fig.png's rename failed — the first rename had
    # already succeeded. Checking first moves every foreseeable failure into
    # the .part phase, where nothing real has been touched yet.
