<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A strategy planner (Step 3.1: GEN_STRAT in the invention loop)

Each iteration of the invention loop runs: GEN_STRAT → GEN_PLAN → GEN_ART → GEN_REPORT_TEXT → REVIEW_REPORT → UPD_HYPO
Artifact types: RESEARCH (web search), EXPERIMENT (code), DATASET (data collection), EVALUATION (metrics), PROOF (Lean 4)
State persists across iterations: strategies, plans, artifacts, report_texts (read from the run tree)

You received the hypothesis, iteration status (current + remaining), previous iteration's strategies, available artifact types, existing artifacts, and reviewer feedback.
Your strategy governs THIS iteration only. You define what artifacts to create NOW.

Focused strategy → efficient progress. Scattered strategy → wasted iteration.

</skills>

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), with base_url=os.environ["OPENROUTER_BASE_URL"] and api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"] (the OpenAI SDK's defaults, OPENAI_BASE_URL and OPENAI_API_KEY, point at the same place, so a plain OpenAI() client also works with OpenRouter model ids). The key is this run's own OpenRouter key and works only at that base URL: never hard-code OpenRouter's own URL, or every call fails with 401
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budgets>

Each artifact executor has a fixed time budget (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors):

- research: 3h
- dataset: 6h
- experiment: 6h
- evaluation: 3h
- proof: 3h

</time_budgets>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<research_methodology>
Think like a researcher planning a study for a top venue.

- All strategies run in parallel and their artifacts combine into one pool. Together they must build toward a publishable paper — each strategy contributes a distinct, necessary piece. No strategy should be a standalone island.
- Ask yourself: what would a reviewer need to see? Proper baselines, controlled comparisons, ablations that isolate what matters. Plan artifacts that preempt reviewer objections.
- Depth over breadth. One well-designed experiment with proper controls beats five shallow ones.
- Match your evaluation to your claims. Measure what the hypothesis actually asserts.
- When results are weak or partial, vary the approach before writing it off. One failed method doesn't falsify the hypothesis.
- If iterations remain, think about what the NEXT iteration will need. Leave useful building blocks — datasets, baselines, preliminary results — that future strategies can build on, refine, or compare against.
</research_methodology>

<principles>
1. FOCUS ON NOVELTY - every strategy must lead to a genuinely novel contribution
2. MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION - all artifacts in your strategy run in parallel
3. BUILD ON EXISTING WORK - use completed artifacts from previous iterations, learn from failures
4. ITERATE ON THE METHOD - a negative result is first about the approach, not the hypothesis. Try different methods, parameters, data, or formulations. When the hypothesis itself has been widened, that same energy goes into testing SEVERAL candidate answers at once rather than one of them harder.
5. TWO SHAPES OF ITERATION - a DEEP TEST pushes one claim further; a WIDE SCREEN tests several candidate answers cheaply in parallel and confirms the survivor on held-out evidence. Read which one this iteration is from the hypothesis and the instructions in the user prompt, and build that shape. Never answer a widened hypothesis with one more deep test.
6. NEVER SHRINK TO FIT - do not plan an iteration whose best possible outcome is a smaller, safer version of a claim that already came back weak. If the claim is in trouble, the strategy's job is to put better candidates in play, not to find a corner where the old one survives.
7. DIAGNOSE BEFORE DECIDING - before each iteration, review what worked, what didn't, and why. Use that to choose what to try next. Gaps are action items, not conclusions.
8. SET DEPENDENCIES WISELY - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects referencing existing artifacts; each label is a short free-text type (a word or two, e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends") that tags how the dep is used
9. PLAN FOR DEPENDENCIES - if an artifact depends on another (e.g. experiments need datasets), ensure prerequisites exist first or plan them this iteration for the next
</principles>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_strat/gen_strat_1`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_strat/gen_strat_1/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_strat/gen_strat_1/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_strat/gen_strat_1/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Write the workspace path of each kept artifact into your results and your
`README.md`, so the paper can cite it by path rather than by a link that
was never pushed.
</disposable_outputs>

<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Peer agreement vs judges on long sentences
hypothesis: |-
  kind: hypothesis (iteration 3 of 5; move = DEEPEN on the one lead that survived held-out testing: cross-family solver consensus)

  CORRECTED RECORD OF ITERATION 2 (every number below was executed; it replaces the report's wording where the two disagree).
  (i) HELD-OUT RESULT (dataset E, R_AB = tiers A+B, 1,822 ERROR / 864 CORRECT, 292 sentences; exp 5 results/tables.md, reviewer audit/pt_vs_s4.json).
    - Frozen PEER+TEXT (PT) 0.790 pooled; c_score_align 0.782; NF-anchored c_score 0.743; TEXT (L2-bow + L3) 0.693; local Qwen3-8B disguised judge 0.710.
    - STRATIFIED (within-stratum pairs; the within-stratum placebo is 0.59, so pooled AUROCs carry about 0.09 of stratum-composition signal): PT 0.753, c_score_align 0.741, PEER-g 0.694, TEXT 0.670, judge 0.677. PT − judge +0.075 [0.036, 0.114]; long pool (L25+L20+EXC) +0.086 [0.049, 0.126]; R_A L20+EXC +0.208 [0.105, 0.305]; CTRL −0.031 n.s.
    - Against the local baseline stack (exp 6 S4_local = every requested baseline except API models, cross-fitted on fold_E): PT − S4_local +0.042 [0.014, 0.070]; c_score_align − S4_local +0.035 [0.006, 0.064]; PT − S4 without an LLM judge +0.087 [0.053, 0.119]; nested [S4_local + PT] over refit S4_local +0.055 [0.036, 0.074]. On the long pool PT is 0.769 and S4_local 0.711. These are the run's first 'adds signal beyond the baselines' numbers, but ONLY against LOCAL comparators.
    - The fusion adds nothing over consensus alone: PT − c_score_align, stratified, +0.011 [−0.012, 0.038]; on R_A it is −0.036 (c_score_align 0.860 > PT 0.818). TEXT is WORSE than the local 8B judge (−0.019 n.s. pooled; −0.180 [−0.331, −0.022] on CTRL). So the object that survived is the CONSENSUS signal, not the fusion.
  (ii) UNTESTED BARS. The pre-registered API flash-lite disguised judge is untestable on E (the shared key was exhausted; only 20 rows were scored on E, plus 1,106 screen rows). There are no API SC-5, API round-trip, gpt-4.1-nano or frontier-judge rows on E. The frontier judge's screen advantage STRENGTHENS under panel labels: +0.077 [0.006, 0.154] under solver labels (p=.015) becomes +0.166 under panel A+B (n=90). It still costs $0.0029/call, above the $0.002 gate.
  (iii) CONFOUNDS STILL OPEN.
    - c_score_align shares align() with the solver labeller. It is strongest where labels are most solver-based (tier A 0.860), and on the 58/62/55 solver-CORRECT→panel-ERROR flips it catches only 34%, vs 81-83% for bow/fused.
    - Its RENAME false-alarm rate is 0.859, which fails the user's invariance requirement. NF-anchored consensus (post hoc on the screen, then scored once on E) has RENAME FA 0.074 but costs 0.039 AUROC (NF fusion vs PT −0.031 [−0.042, −0.020]). NF-fusion − judge is +0.047 [0.011, 0.082].
  (iv) MECHANISM PREDICTIONS P1-P4.
    - P1 INCONCLUSIVE. PEER > TEXT on COVERAGE errors, +0.093 [0.046, 0.147]. On PEER_ENDORSED errors TEXT − PEER is −0.030 [−0.090, 0.021] n.s.; the +0.103 is the PEER_ENDORSED_NF group. The local judge has the HIGHEST recall on both endorsed groups (0.169 and 0.199).
    - P2 REFUTED: Spearman(PEER, TEXT | error) = 0.294.
    - P3: the metric's own length interaction is ~0 (−0.023). The gap to the judge grows with length because the judge degrades (diff-in-Δ +0.146 [0.020, 0.269]). Exp 6's GEE slopes of correctness per SD of words: judge −0.56, round-trip NLI −0.70, B2 −0.62, S4 −0.29, SC-5 +0.27 n.s.
    - P4 REFUTED: fused RENAME FA 0.385. Compare FA with FA: FOL-Triage fused RENAME FA was 0.22; its 0.013 was a flip rate.
    - Unit-code error typing is at chance on E: 0.371 vs 0.382 (the screen's 81%-vs-46% operator match did not replicate). The local judge types 0.022.
  (v) DEAD ENDS, closed with one sentence each and no further budget.
    - B2 world probe (exp 6): 0.574 pooled, 0.509 long. Its reader failed the pre-registered gate (balanced accuracy 0.476 vs ≥0.85), so it is not eligible for fusion. Dropped-condition UNDETERMINED is 0.529. A post-hoc thinking-mode reader gets 0.79 on 124/251 items, which is not pursued. Iteration 1 never started B2 (broken) and iteration 2 ran it and failed it (null), so B2 is DROPPED.
    - B1 (template verbaliser + bidirectional NLI) was never run in any iteration. It is deprioritised, because its closest executed kin, round-trip NLI, is 0.626 on E with the steepest length decay.
    - R_ADJ (gen_art_dataset_2): Sonnet-5 gate balanced accuracy 0.767 (0.975 on synthetic items, 0.662 on expert track-H pairs; it judged 15/37 expert-rejected originals FAITHFUL). Grok-4.20 scored 0.634. The regime was DROPPED, and it is NOT retried. Finding: frontier adjudicators agree with experts on real (not synthetic) NL→FOL errors only about 2/3 of the time. This bounds label reliability on real errors, and it is reported as an answer to the user's 'how biased are the labels' question.
    - Pilot structural metrics: 0.50-0.54 on E (null again); pilot_rerun_jacc 0.660.
    - The FOL-Triage L1/L2-role layers are closed as before.
    - The iteration-2 §2.3 'R_ADJ' regimes are dataset E's own Haiku/GLM/Kimi screen audit; they are renamed R_PANEL_*.
  (vi) CONTAMINATION.
    - On E, exp 6 finds a Llama-8B judge DiD of +0.162 [0.064, 0.261], consistent with memorisation of MALLS gold. Qwen-8B DiD is +0.036 n.s. (MDE 0.107).
    - Disguise IMPROVES the Qwen judge on E (+0.064), but on the screen the ORIGINAL cheap API judge had higher recall at matched FA (+0.11/+0.20). The 'forces structural reading' story is untested.
    - Consensus has no text channel, so it cannot be contaminated through the text.
  (vii) LABEL FACTS. Correct-but-not-equivalent shares under R_AB: L25 0.773, L20 0.721, EXC 0.441, CTRL 0.215. The panel judges MALLS gold wrong in 0.822 of rows, and accepts 0.613 of expert-corrected formulas. Test-retest Spearman is 0.989.

  CLAIM (held and sharpened; the object is the consensus signal, with the fusion demoted to a secondary row).
  CROSS-FAMILY SOLVER CONSENSUS is a gold-free faithfulness metric for NL→FOL. The metric is the share of other model families' translations of the same sentence that are z3-equivalent to the candidate modulo a vocabulary map, used either graded or exact. It beats the PRE-REGISTERED API cheap judge and the FULL requested baseline stack INCLUDING API judges, and it adds signal over that stack. It holds on held-out long, heavily conditioned sentences and on a stratum whose labels involve NO vocabulary alignment at all, which closes the shared-aligner confound. It does this at ≤10% of a frontier judge's cost, and a rename-invariant version keeps that advantage.
  MECHANISM (the non-obvious part, and why it should hold where judges fail): the ANNA KARENINA PRINCIPLE OF TRANSLATION. Correct translations of a sentence converge on one logical content. Wrong ones scatter, because the number of distinct ways to drop, add, rescope or misattach conditions grows combinatorially with the number of conditions. So the chance that independent families make the SAME error (a peer-endorsed error, consensus's only blind spot) should FALL as sentences get longer and more conditioned. A judge must hold the whole sentence and formula in one reading, and that degrades with length (−0.56/SD). Two forces oppose each other:
    (+) error scatter grows with conditions;
    (−) legitimate divergence among CORRECT translations (granularity or vocabulary; 0.77 of L25 CORRECT rows are not equivalent to the reference) grows with words.
  Consensus holds its AUROC with length only if (+) at least offsets (−). Both outcomes are informative, and the decomposition is the finding.
  One-sentence finding if it holds: 'For NL→FOL you do not need a gold formula or a large judge. Whether other model families' translations are solver-equivalent to yours predicts faithfulness better than an LLM judge and every standard baseline combined, and the advantage grows on long conditioned sentences, because correct translations converge while errors scatter.'

  TESTS (priority order; each executor ≤$10; run API arms right after the 00:00 UTC key reset, with local fallback rows kept as secondary).
  T1 HEAD-ON BAR ON E (the baseline the lead has not yet met).
    - Score all R_AB + tier-A decided E rows with the pre-registered API judges: flash-lite, original and disguised (~$0.4), and gpt-4.1-nano, both views.
    - Score a stratified 300-row subsample with the frontier judge (gemini-3.1-pro), original and disguised (~$2).
    - Run API SC-5 (gpt-4.1-nano, T=0.7) on a stratified 1,500 rows, and API round-trip NLI on all rows.
    - Rebuild S4_full = cross-fitted combination of ALL baselines, including the API judges, on the existing fold_E.
    - The PEER scores are ALREADY FROZEN in exp 5 per_item_E.jsonl. Only the comparators are new, so this is a confirmation, not a re-screen.
    - Primary statistic: STRATIFIED paired ΔAUROC, sentence-clustered bootstrap B=2000; pooled numbers are secondary.
  T2 ALIGNER-FREE CONFIRMATION: R_COMP, completed (a fix, once).
    - 250 main templated long sentences (≥25 words, ≥3 conditions, unless/except/provided-that), references trusted by construction (weak and strong readings), from gen_art_dataset_3.
    - Candidates come from the same 10 generator slots in TWO conditions:
      - FREE (realistic; labelled by solver-modulo-alignment, with panel adjudication for VOCAB rows);
      - SIG: the generator receives the template's predicate signature, only so that labels become PURE z3 equivalence to the weak/strong references with no alignment anywhere. This is a labelling device, not a grounded-vs-ungrounded comparison.
    - In SIG, consensus needs no aligner either, so the shared-instrument confound is absent by construction.
    - Testability (≥50 ERROR and ≥50 CORRECT) is declared before scoring. If R_COMP breaks again, it is dropped.
    - Also score a vocab-exact subset of E: rows whose predicate/constant names match the reference after normalisation, so the labeller needs no alignment. This is pre-registered as a second confound control (the screen analogue was 0.852 vs SC 0.714).
  T3 RENAME-INVARIANT CONSENSUS.
    - PEER_HYB: a pair counts as agreeing if EITHER the name-similarity map OR the name-free structural map (arity, monotonicity, block position, argument graph, text anchor) verifies z3 equivalence.
    - The variant (HYB vs NF-anchored vs ALIGN) and its thresholds are selected on the iteration-1 screen plus E, which are now development data. It is CONFIRMED only on R_COMP (never seen).
    - Target: RENAME FA ≤0.10 on the shared rewrite set (exp D's 282 rewrites + PERTURB RENAME_SYN and RENAME_NONCE controls, analysed separately), with AUROC within 0.01 of ALIGN on R_COMP.
    - Over-alignment is measured as recall on PERTURB MEANING_RENAME and SWAP.
  T4 MECHANISM DECOMPOSITION (CPU only, on E + R_COMP). By words, n_conditions and exceptions:
    - M1: the peer-endorsement (coincident-error) rate among errors;
    - M2: the divergence rate (not equivalent to the peer majority) among CORRECT rows;
    - M3: the number of distinct z3 classes among erroneous vs correct outputs per sentence;
    - M4: consensus AUROC vs peer count k = 1..9 (leave-one-family-out), per length tercile, plus cost per sentence at each k.
  T5 PER-TYPE SENSITIVITY AND TYPING ON PERTURB (4,234 mutants + 868 controls, known labels).
    - Every metric is scored per operator × DOWN/UP. Consensus uses the E sentence's real generator outputs as peers.
    - Synthetic only and NEVER pooled with real-error AUROC. QUANT/REV/RESTR are UP-only; SCOPE and UNGLUE have 0 rows.
    - Error-type identification: medoid minimal-typed-repair operator vs the known operator, against chance and the judge. If it is at chance again, the answer 'no gold-free metric here identifies error type' is reported as a negative.
  TEXT (L2-bow + L3) and the frozen PT fusion are carried as secondary rows at no new cost, because they catch the solver-CORRECT→panel-ERROR flips that the aligner masks. They get no new development budget.

  SUCCESS CRITERIA (pre-registered).
  CONFIRM (the lead becomes a genuine positive), all of:
    (a) stratified Δ(c_score_align) − judge_cheap_disg (API flash-lite) has a CI > 0 on E R_AB pooled AND on the long pool, with a positive sign on R_A L20+EXC;
    (b) nested [S4_full + consensus] over refit S4_full has a CI > 0 on R_AB;
    (c) on R_COMP-SIG, consensus − judge_cheap_disg has a CI > 0 (if testable), with a positive sign on R_COMP-FREE and on E's vocab-exact subset;
    (d) either consensus ≥ 0.95 × the frontier judge's AUROC on the 300-row subsample at ≤10% of its cost, or nested [frontier + consensus] > frontier with a CI > 0;
    (e) the confirmed rename-invariant variant satisfies (a) and (c) with RENAME FA ≤ 0.10.
  PARTIAL: (a) and (b) hold on E but (c) fails, meaning the aligner confound cannot be excluded. Or (a) holds while (b) does not, meaning consensus is redundant with the API judge. Either is reported as such.
  DISCONFIRM: (a) fails against the API judge. The judge is then the user's incumbent, and the consensus advantage from iteration 2 is attributed to a weak local bar.
  MECHANISM, each scored CONFIRMED or REFUTED:
    - M1: the peer-endorsement rate among errors falls with n_conditions (GEE slope < 0, CI excludes 0);
    - M2: divergence among CORRECT rows rises with words;
    - M3: consensus's length slope is less negative than the API judge's (difference CI > 0);
    - M4: the k needed to reach 95% of the k=9 AUROC is ≤5 families.
  Power: pooled E paired MDE ≈ 0.04, long pool ≈ 0.05. R_COMP (~2,500 rows per condition) is declared testable or not before scoring.

  USER DELIVERABLES carried in the same pass:
    - item-level AUROC/AUPRC and precision/recall/FA at frozen thresholds;
    - system-level Kendall τ-b over 13 rows and 11 families (PT 0.718, judge 0.667, B2 −0.026 so far);
    - per-type sensitivity (T5);
    - one shared rewrite set for every metric;
    - coverage with every unparseable row in the denominator (12.8% on E);
    - $ and seconds per item, including the peer-pool cost;
    - complexity curves (words, quantifiers, depth, conditions, exceptions);
    - contamination with MDE for every LLM component;
    - gold-error and correct-but-not-equivalent rates, plus the adjudicator-vs-expert ceiling from R_ADJ's failed gate;
    - reusable functions with precise docstrings: consensus_score(text, fol, peers, mode={align, nf, hyb}), graded_consensus, name_free_align, peer_pool(text, families, k), and the released labelling tools equivalent_modulo_vocab and minimal_typed_repair.
motivation: >-
  The user needs to score (text, FOL) pairs with no gold, and has warned that detecting synthetic perturbations is not the
  target. Two in-step facts reshape the design. (1) Real errors are not where perturbation suites look. After vocabulary alignment,
  polarity-type single edits are about 10% of repairable real errors, while a uniform typed suite (our iteration-2 suite:
  3 of 10 operators) spends 30% of its mass on them. Nearly half of real errors are multi-edit restructurings. Coverage (a
  missing condition, an added property) dominates the rest. (2) Real errors split by what is needed to SEE them. About a quarter
  are visible from the formula alone, as shapes almost no English sentence has (∃x(A→B), glued independent claims, a restrictor
  inside ↔, free variables). Those can be flagged with near-zero false alarms, no text, no LLM and no gold, and the check
  cannot be contaminated. The rest need the text, and a bag-of-words check is too weak for them, so role-level accounting
  or a text-only questionnaire is required. This gives the user three things. First, a cheap, deterministic L1 layer that
  flags a known share of errors with a known false-alarm rate, and that also audits gold: it found an error in the curated
  corrected gold. Second, a principled place to spend small-LLM money (L3), only where L1/L2 are blind. Third, a validation
  recipe (census-reweighted typed perturbations) that says when a cheap synthetic test suite can stand in for real labelled
  errors. That matters because gold is rare and partly wrong (about 36-39% of original FOLIO/MALLS gold, per 2606.02837).
  The long, heavily conditioned stratum the user cares about is now labelable. MALLS-train holds 1,501 sentences of at least
  25 words with 3 or more conditions, and 986 exception-bearing sentences of at least 15 words, which replaces the infeasible
  SARA Prolog. That is where the pilot shows both the biggest risk (L1 false alarms rise at 20 words or more) and the biggest
  opportunity: in the pilot census the COMPOUND share of errors rises from 7/27 (26%) under 12 words to 14/24 (58%) at 20
  words or more, exactly the mass that single-invariant checks and typed perturbations miss.
assumptions:
- >-
  Corrected gold anchors real-error labels well enough once it is itself audited. The pilot shows that the curated gold contains
  residual errors: L1 flagged the corrected vaccine formula ∃x(A→B). Automatic vocabulary alignment over-accepts meaning-changing
  renames: 21/99 is an upper bound, and bag-of-words L2 fires on 4 of those 21. So every VOCAB/GRAN and COMPOUND pair, plus
  a 20% sample of the rest, goes to a 3-family adjudication panel on disguised items. The panel's own accuracy is measured
  first on typed perturbations, split by DOWN and UP position. Curator AMBIGUITY flags define a separate 'reading choice'
  label class that is never pooled with errors.
- >-
  Formula smells mined from annotator errors transfer to LLM errors, at least partly. This is the main risk to C1(a). It is
  tested directly: L1 false alarms are measured per family on verified-correct LLM outputs (equivalent to corrected gold modulo
  alignment, or panel-confirmed), and L1 precision on real LLM errors. If a smell exceeds 3% false alarms for any family it
  is dropped, and that is reported, not tuned.
- >-
  A small LLM that reads only the sentence can fill a fixed role schema (condition vs assertion, force, negation, claim grouping,
  argument order) with ≥ 85% per-field accuracy. This is measured on the gold-derived schema answers of verified items before
  L3 is fused. Because L3 never sees a formula, it cannot copy a memorised gold formula. Contamination is still checked by
  comparing original items with disguised items (entities and predicates renamed).
- >-
  Enough labelled long items exist. MALLS-train gives 1,501 items with at least 25 words and 3 conditions, and 4,539 with
  at least 20 words and 3 conditions (probes/complexity_counts.out.txt). Its GPT-4 gold is noisy, so a stratified 600 are
  relabelled by the panel. FOLIO-refined (19 such premises) and ProverQA-hard (0 long conditioned sentences among 8,948) cannot
  fill this stratum. A stratum is tested only if it holds at least 50 errors AND at least 50 correct outputs.
- >-
  The z3 fragment covers the data. 8 of 302 curated corrected formulas fail our parser, and 334 of 27,284 MALLS-train formulas
  fail. Every unparseable output is counted in the denominator as a coverage failure. Timeouts are labelled UNKNOWN and never
  merged with proofs.
investigation_approach: >-
  COMPONENT MAP (layer: target error types; pilot reach on real human errors; calibration status). L1 lint: GLUE/UNGLUE, RESTR,
  BIND/free variable, ∃→ and ↔-restrictor structure, well-formedness; 47% of structural/polarity-type, 28% of compound, 12%
  of coverage errors; 1.7% false alarms on gold, still to be calibrated per LLM family. L2 accounting: ADD/DROP coverage,
  constants, predicate substitution; bag-of-words form 32% of coverage errors at 8.5% false alarms (paired AUROC 0.58); role-aware
  form not yet probed. L2 polarity/slot rules: NEG/REV/QUANT/SWAP; iteration-2 anchor 0.86-0.88 on synthetic REV/∀→∃, but
  polarity-type is only 10% of real repaired errors. L3 questionnaire: conditions vs assertions, claim grouping, force and
  order, aimed at COMPOUND and coverage; not yet probed, gated on ≥ 85% per-field accuracy. ARTIFACT PLAN (each executor has
  ≤ $10 of OpenRouter spend, tracked after every call; costs are estimated before each sweep). STEP 0, PRE-REGISTRATION: freeze
  the smell list, the L2 rules, the L3 schema, the thresholds, the splits, the strata and the analyses before any LLM-output
  label is seen. Go/no-go gate per component: ≤ 10% false alarms on verified-correct outputs in every length stratum, otherwise
  the component is dropped and the drop is reported. STEP 1, META-EVALUATION SET (dataset artifact, ≈ $8). (a) HUMAN TRACK:
  the curated FOLIO-validation conclusions and MALLS-test subset (302 items; 99 non-equivalent original→corrected pairs),
  plus a natural SPECIFICITY set: sentences shared between yfxiao/folio-refined and the DSAVlab-corrected FOLIO, i.e. two
  independent 'correct' annotations, whose non-equivalent pairs must classify as VOCAB/GRAN/CONVENTION or as a residual gold
  error confirmed by the panel. (b) LLM TRACK: about 1,500 sentences stratified by complexity (FOLIO-refined sentences, MALLS-test,
  and a stratified 600 from MALLS-train, oversampling those with at least 20 words, 3 or more conditions or exception markers).
  Candidates come from at least 8 distinct model families on OpenRouter, from small to frontier, each zero- and few-shot,
  plus ccg2lambda (kenken6696/folio_by_ccg2lambda) and the Logic-LM released FOLIO outputs. (c) SEMI-SYNTHETIC COMPOSED items:
  2-4 verified short gold rules nested under 'unless / provided that / except where' templates, with gold derived under both
  weak and strong exception readings. They form a separate stratum and are never pooled with real-error AUROC. (d) TYPED PERTURBATIONS
  of verified gold with the same 12 operators as the census, at matched DOWN/UP positions. (e) MEANING-PRESERVING REWRITES:
  STRICT (renaming, reordering, De Morgan, prenex, contrapositive) and CONVENTION (⊕/∨, weak/strong exception, →/↔ for 'means',
  added sortal restrictor, lexical negation). STEP 2, LABELS AND THEIR BIAS: z3 equivalence to corrected gold → equivalence
  modulo vocabulary (aligner, merge/split and arity-reification bridges) → minimal typed repair (depth ≤ 2, fingerprint-prefiltered,
  z3-verified; code in probes/repair_census.py) → panel adjudication of VOCAB/GRAN/COMPOUND plus a 20% sample. Report precision
  and recall of the automatic vocabulary classifier against the panel, the gold-error rate (including residual errors in corrected
  gold, L1-assisted), the correct-but-not-equivalent rate, the reading-choice rate, and every AUROC under naive, vocabulary-corrected
  and adjudicated labels. STEP 3, CENSUS (C2): minimal-typed-repair classes for human and LLM errors, per family and per complexity
  stratum, with bootstrap CIs. Include a χ² test against the uniform mix of standard perturbation suites and against each
  other. Specificity control: the same classifier on panel-confirmed correct-but-non-equivalent pairs; report error-vs-correct
  contrasts, not raw shares. STEP 4, REUSABLE FUNCTIONS (experiment artifact), each with a precise docstring: fol_lint(fol)
  → smell codes; content_accounting(text, fol); role_accounting(text, fol) (UD roles with generic-subject repair, DOWN-anchor
  polarity, slot order); formula_role_profile(fol) (solver-exact schema answers); role_questionnaire(text) (small LLM, text
  only; cost of about $0.0003 per item); fol_triage(text, fol) → {p_error, fired_layer, codes, coverage_status}; equivalent_modulo_vocab(a,
  b) and minimal_typed_repair(cand, ref), which are the labelling tools released with the dataset. STEP 5, BASELINES: parse
  rate; the pilot's structural metrics (joint-load conflicts, arity consistency, undefined predicates, rerun Jaccard); round-trip
  (a cheap LLM verbalises, then NLI and embedding similarity to the source, plus re-formalise-and-z3-equivalence); a cheap
  LLM judge on all items and a strong judge on a 300-item stratified subsample; K=5 sampling self-consistency modulo vocabulary;
  and a DECOMPOSED judge that sees the formula and is asked the L3 questions, which isolates what solver-exact answering adds.
  STEP 6, ANALYSES (evaluation artifact). Item level: AUROC, AUPRC and precision at the pre-registered threshold. Incremental
  value: nested logistic models with bootstrap ΔAUROC over the best baseline combination, plus partial correlations. System
  level: Kendall τ over families (prompt variants averaged) with a CI, reported descriptively, and over all variants. Per-error-type
  sensitivity by census class. Invariance: false alarms per rewrite family. Coverage, with every failure in the denominator.
  Cost in $ and seconds per item. Complexity: AUROC and false alarms against length, quantifier count, nesting depth, number
  of conditions and number of exceptions. A competing-effects test asks whether the cascade's slope is less negative than
  the judge's. Contamination: judge and round-trip accuracy on original vs disguised items. C3 decomposition: for each non-degenerate
  metric, MIX, WITHIN-TYPE and NOISE terms with paired bootstrap CIs; no τ-across-metrics test. Power: with about 300 errors
  and 300 correct outputs per pooled comparison, the AUROC SE is about 0.02 and the minimum detectable paired ΔAUROC is about
  0.05. Per stratum (≥ 50/50), the MDE is about 0.10; strata below that are declared untestable in advance.
success_criteria: >-
  C1 CONFIRM: (a) L1 precision ≥ 0.8 on real LLM errors, with false alarms ≤ 3% on verified-correct outputs of every model
  family for sentences under 20 words, and a reported, length-conditional false-alarm rate at 20 words or more. (b) The fused
  cascade's ΔAUROC over the best baseline combination has a 95% CI > 0 on adjudicated labels. (c) The cascade reaches AUROC
  ≥ 0.9 × the strong judge's at ≤ 5% of its cost, or beats it in the top complexity stratum. C1 PARTIAL: L1+L2 alone give
  a pre-filter with precision ≥ 0.8 that covers ≥ 25% of real LLM errors (the pilot on human errors shows 27% for L1 at 1.7%
  false alarms), but no ΔAUROC over the judge. This ships as a free first pass, with the remaining error mass stated. C1 DISCONFIRM:
  L1 precision < 0.6 on LLM outputs (the smells do not transfer from annotators to LLMs), AND the ΔAUROC CI includes 0 in
  every stratum. This is reported as a clear negative for structure-only gold-free checks, and the per-layer oracle-vs-deployable
  gap shows whether the checks or the text instruments failed. C2 CONFIRM: on LLM outputs, polarity-type operators ≤ 20% of
  repaired errors (CI upper bound < 0.25), coverage operators ≥ 40%, and the mix differs from uniform (χ² p < 0.01). The classifier
  labels ≥ 80% of panel-confirmed correct-but-non-equivalent pairs as non-errors (specificity control). Human-vs-LLM mix differences
  are reported either way. C2 DISCONFIRM: polarity-type ≥ 35% on LLM outputs, meaning LLMs err differently from annotators.
  This reverses the design priority back toward polarity anchors, and is reported as such. C3 CONFIRM (MIX-dominant): for
  ≥ 2/3 of non-degenerate non-LLM metrics, census-reweighted synthetic sensitivity is within ±0.10 of real sensitivity on
  clean labels. The result, 'typed perturbations are a valid proxy once reweighted by a real-error census', is actionable.
  C3 ALTERNATIVE: the reweighted prediction misses by more than 0.10. Per-operator WITHIN-TYPE ratios are then reported as
  the finding, e.g. that real DROPs remove the least salient condition. In every outcome the label-noise term is reported
  separately, so no gap is attributed to metrics that noise alone explains.

  conventions, and we repaired that; polarity now serves as one L2 rule.
inspiration: >-
  Three imports, each chosen because it directly fixes a measured failure. (1) SOFTWARE STATIC ANALYSIS: linters flag code
  that is almost never intended, without knowing the spec. Bug patterns are mined from real fixes (FindBugs, Getafix, wild-caught
  mutants). Applied to logic, some formulas are almost never what English means, so they can be flagged without reading the
  text. The pilot: 27% of real errors, 1.7% false alarms. (2) CLINICAL SCREENING CASCADES: a cheap, high-specificity test
  runs first, and costlier tests run only where the cheap one is blind, each with its false-positive rate fixed on known negatives.
  That fixes the compounding false alarms of iteration 1 and spends LLM money only on the error mass L1/L2 cannot see. (3)
  SUMMARIZATION FACTUALITY and MUTATION-TESTING methodology: census real errors first, then weight synthetic tests by that
  census (FRANK; Just et al.). In FOL this becomes testable exactly, because the minimal repair between a candidate and a
  reference can be SEARCHED and PROVED with a solver instead of annotated by hand.
terms:
- term: FOL-Triage
  definition: >-
    The proposed gold-free metric: L1 formula lint (no text), L2 text accounting (no LLM), L3 text-only role questionnaire
    (small LLM) compared with solver-exact formula answers. The three are fused into P(unfaithful), with the firing layer
    and an error code.
- term: Formula smell (lint rule)
  definition: >-
    A deterministic formula-only pattern that almost no English sentence means, e.g. ∃x(A→B), ∀x(A∧B), a restrictor inside
    ↔, glued independent claims, a free variable, an arity clash, a vacuous predicate, or a valid/unsatisfiable formula.
- term: Minimal typed repair
  definition: >-
    The smallest set of typed edits (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE) that makes
    a candidate provably equivalent (z3) to the corrected gold after vocabulary alignment. More than 2 edits, or no repair
    found, is COMPOUND. It defines the error type of a real error.
- term: Vocabulary alignment
  definition: >-
    Renaming candidate predicates and constants onto reference ones (same arity, token/character similarity), plus merge/split
    and arity-reification bridges. Equivalence after alignment means VOCAB/GRAN, i.e. not an error. It is an upper bound,
    because meaning-changing renames also align, so it is adjudicated.
- term: Reading choice
  definition: >-
    A correction on a sentence the curators flagged ambiguous, where the gold picks one legitimate reading. It is a separate
    label class, not an error.
- term: Transfer decomposition (MIX / WITHIN-TYPE / NOISE)
  definition: >-
    A metric's synthetic-minus-real sensitivity is split into three parts. MIX: per-type synthetic sensitivity reweighted
    by the real census. WITHIN-TYPE: the same operator, synthetic vs real. NOISE: naive vs adjudicated labels.
- term: Solver-exact answerer
  definition: >-
    z3 queries that read role facts off a formula exactly: per-predicate monotonicity (DOWN = condition, UP = asserted), quantifier
    force per claim block, connectivity components (independent claims) and argument slots.
- term: Correct-but-not-equivalent
  definition: >-
    A faithful candidate that is not logically equivalent to gold because of vocabulary, granularity or a legitimate convention.
    It is estimated by alignment plus panel adjudication.
summary: >-
  FOL-Triage is a three-layer gold-free faithfulness check for NL→FOL: a text-free formula lint, LLM-free text accounting
  and a text-only small-LLM role questionnaire answered exactly by a solver on the formula side. In-step, the lint alone flagged
  27% of real annotator errors at 1.7% false alarms, and found an error in curated gold. The hypothesis also covers a minimal-typed-repair
  census of real errors (coverage dominates; polarity is about 10%; 46% compound) and a MIX/WITHIN-TYPE/NOISE decomposition
  of why synthetic perturbation tests overstate metric quality.
alternates:
- title: Text judges truth in solver-built worlds
  hypothesis: >-
    z3 builds small models that separate the candidate from its own typed single-edit mutants (the census operators). Each
    model is verbalised by template, and a small NLI model judges whether that situation is consistent with the text. The
    mismatch rate predicts real errors, including COMPOUND ones, with no gold and no large LLM.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    46% of real errors are compound restructurings that no role field isolates. A truth-value judgement on concrete situations
    sees any behavioural difference through one mechanism. It beats FOL-Triage if the small NLI model judges templated worlds
    with at least about 85% accuracy on long conditioned sentences.
- title: Agreement across systems by repair distance
  hypothesis: >-
    For each sentence, several diverse systems' outputs are aligned modulo vocabulary. A candidate's minimal-typed-repair
    distance to the cross-system medoid (0 = equivalent, 1-2 = typed edit, 3+ = compound) is its error score, and the repair
    operators give the error type.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It needs no text-side instrument at all, which removes the weakest link (L2 bag-of-words AUROC was 0.59). It wins if errors
    are idiosyncratic across model families. It loses where families share a blind spot or a reading choice, which the census
    measures.
- title: Template verbalisation plus bidirectional entailment
  hypothesis: >-
    A deterministic, non-repairing FOL→English template verbaliser, plus a small NLI model checking entailment in both directions
    against the source, predicts faithfulness. Missing content fails text→formula entailment, and added content fails formula→text
    entailment.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    Coverage operators are 57% of repairable real errors, and bag-of-words accounting is weak on them. If NLI handles templated
    logical English, it captures coverage in context, which bag-of-words matching cannot, without any alignment step.
- title: A disguised cheap judge is enough
  hypothesis: >-
    A cheap LLM judge, shown the sentence and the formula with every predicate and constant renamed to neutral tokens (so
    memorised gold cannot help), matches the strong judge. Neither the lint nor the questionnaire adds signal over it.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If current small LLMs already recognise ∃x(A→B)-style shapes and dropped conditions, structure adds nothing and the cheapest
    reliable metric is the judge. C1(b)'s ΔAUROC test decides between them directly.

  The shared-aligner confound gets a confound-free test. R_COMP is completed (a fix, once) in FREE and SIG conditions. In

  ALIGN 0.859 FA; NF 0.074 FA but −0.039 AUROC).

  PERTURB (4,234 mutants + 868 controls) is scored for per-operator × DOWN/UP sensitivity and typing accuracy. It is synthetic

  The contamination statement is corrected: exp 6's Llama-8B DiD on E is +0.162 [0.064, 0.261], consistent with memorisation;

If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends.

<domain_reasoning>
FIRST WORK OUT HOW RESEARCHERS IN THIS FIELD REASON. Then choose the strategy.

The hypothesis names a field. Before proposing anything, establish how people
who publish in that field actually think — not research advice in general,
which holds everywhere and so settles nothing here.

Answer these four, for THIS field:

1. PRINCIPLES. What does the field take as given, and what does it still
   argue about? What has to be true of a study before anyone in it will read
   the result at all?
2. WHAT COUNTS AS CONVINCING. What kind of evidence makes a claim believed
   here — an effect on held-out cases, a controlled comparison, a replication
   across populations, a proof, a mechanism shown rather than correlated, a
   preregistered prediction that came true? Fields disagree about this, and
   the disagreement is what a strategy has to be built around.
3. STANDARD MOVES AND THEIR RATIONALE. Which methodological moves does a
   competent group reach for first, and what does each one EXIST to rule out?
   A move whose purpose you cannot state is a ritual, and copying it will not
   protect the result.
4. USUAL FAILURE MODES. How does work in this field normally go wrong —
   the confound everyone forgets, the measure that drifts from the construct,
   the baseline that was never tuned, the result that never replicates, the
   sample too small to carry the claim?

HOW MUCH EFFORT. This is a bounded step, not an artifact. Read the one domain
handbook that fits (if one does), and run a handful of targeted lookups on how
the field states its own norms — a review, a methods paper, a reproducibility
or replication study, a venue's reviewer guidance. Then stop and plan. If no
handbook and no clear norms exist for this field, say so plainly in
`domain_reasoning` and treat every principle you name as provisional.

WHAT TO WRITE.
- `domain_reasoning`: the four answers above, specific to this field, in a few
  sentences each. Name the field. Cite what you actually read. Anything you
  could have written without knowing which field this is does not belong here.
- `principle_alignment`: which of those principles THIS strategy follows and
  how, and which it deliberately BREAKS, with the reason each break is worth
  it and what you are doing instead to keep the result credible. Breaking a
  principle on purpose is a legitimate move and is sometimes the contribution
  itself — an unnamed break is the failure. "Follows all of them" is an
  answer only when it is true; say which ones and where.

The strategy that follows has to be the one this reasoning implies. If the
field's own standard of evidence rules out the cheap version of your idea,
plan the version it does not rule out.

Remaining (including this one): 3
</iteration_status>

<candidate_alternates>
Runner-up answers to the same ask, carried from hypothesis generation. These are the
candidate population a wide screen draws on — treat them as real options, not as context.

--- Candidate 1 ---
title: Text judges truth in solver-built worlds
hypothesis: >-
  z3 builds small models that separate the candidate from its own typed single-edit mutants (the census operators). Each model
  is verbalised by template, and a small NLI model judges whether that situation is consistent with the text. The mismatch
  rate predicts real errors, including COMPOUND ones, with no gold and no large LLM.
why_it_could_win: >-
  46% of real errors are compound restructurings that no role field isolates. A truth-value judgement on concrete situations
  sees any behavioural difference through one mechanism. It beats FOL-Triage if the small NLI model judges templated worlds
  with at least about 85% accuracy on long conditioned sentences.

--- Candidate 2 ---
title: Agreement across systems by repair distance
hypothesis: >-
  For each sentence, several diverse systems' outputs are aligned modulo vocabulary. A candidate's minimal-typed-repair distance
  to the cross-system medoid (0 = equivalent, 1-2 = typed edit, 3+ = compound) is its error score, and the repair operators
  give the error type.
why_it_could_win: >-
  It needs no text-side instrument at all, which removes the weakest link (L2 bag-of-words AUROC was 0.59). It wins if errors
  are idiosyncratic across model families. It loses where families share a blind spot or a reading choice, which the census
  measures.

--- Candidate 3 ---
title: Template verbalisation plus bidirectional entailment
hypothesis: >-
  A deterministic, non-repairing FOL→English template verbaliser, plus a small NLI model checking entailment in both directions
  against the source, predicts faithfulness. Missing content fails text→formula entailment, and added content fails formula→text
  entailment.
why_it_could_win: >-
  Coverage operators are 57% of repairable real errors, and bag-of-words accounting is weak on them. If NLI handles templated
  logical English, it captures coverage in context, which bag-of-words matching cannot, without any alignment step.

--- Candidate 4 ---
title: A disguised cheap judge is enough
hypothesis: >-
  A cheap LLM judge, shown the sentence and the formula with every predicate and constant renamed to neutral tokens (so memorised
  gold cannot help), matches the strong judge. Neither the lint nor the questionnaire adds signal over it.
why_it_could_win: >-
  If current small LLMs already recognise ∃x(A→B)-style shapes and dropped conditions, structure adds nothing and the cheapest
  reliable metric is the judge. C1(b)'s ΔAUROC test decides between them directly.
</candidate_alternates>



<latch_iteration>
THIS ITERATION LATCHES ONTO WHAT ALREADY WORKED.

The previous round produced something real — a genuine positive, or a lead
worth making bigger — and the revision's move is `deepen`, `extend` or `fix`
(`_move` on the hypothesis). So the OBJECT of this iteration is already
fixed: it is that result. Not a wider title, not a new question.

Spend EVERY artifact slot attacking that same object from a different side:

- MECHANISM — why it holds; what would have to be true for it to hold; the
  intermediate the effect travels through.
- BOUNDARY — the condition, size, regime or population where it stops.
- CONFOUND — the alternative account a reviewer names first, tested head-on
  so that it can actually lose.
- REPLICATION — the same claim on a SECOND family, population, period,
  corpus, site, cohort or case set the first result never touched.
- FIX — a strand that came back broken, run correctly, claim unchanged.
- If the object is a LEAD rather than a genuine positive: MORE POWER and a
  CLEANER MEASURE, so the next round can tell a real effect from a small one.
  When a power analysis or the effect sizes already on record say the panel
  cannot detect an effect this size, that budget buys more graded samples or
  checkpoints — not more candidate metrics. A wider panel of readouts over
  the same underpowered set does not change what the numbers can tell you.

Strands that came back null last round are CLOSED: one sentence in the paper,
no artifact here. Do not re-run them, do not widen away from a result that
worked, and do not spend a slot on an unrelated new candidate — that is what
a widen iteration is for, and this is not one.

kind: strategy
id: gen_strat_1_idx1
domain_reasoning: >-
  FIELD: meta-evaluation of reference-free (gold-free) quality metrics, applied to neuro-symbolic text-to-logic (NL->FOL autoformalization).
  Its norms come from three places: semantic-parsing and autoformalization evaluation (neurosymbolic handbook), summarization-factuality
  meta-evaluation (TRUE, Honovich et al. NAACL 2022; SummaC; FRANK; Goyal & Durrett 2021), and the WMT metrics shared tasks
  (Freitag et al.; Deutsch, Dror & Roth TACL 2021 on bootstrap CIs for metric correlations; Deutsch et al. EMNLP 2023 'Ties
  Matter'). What I read for this step: the neurosymbolic handbook; iteration 1's four artifacts (per-item scores, READMEs,
  dataset card §3-§11); and the reviewer's audit scripts (review_report/audit: paired_boot, rescore_adjudicated, join_audit).
  I did no new web lookups, so the MT and summarization norms below are cited from standing knowledge and are treated as provisional
  where they go beyond the handbook. (1) PRINCIPLES. A metric is only as credible as its labels. The handbook's hard rule
  is never to score on FOLIO/MALLS as shipped (about 36-39% of gold is wrong, 2606.02837). Compiling or being provable is
  not faithfulness (2604.19459, 2606.16541). Gold-free round-trip certification is an occupied lane (2604.25031), so it can
  only be a baseline. Still disputed: whether any gold-free faithfulness number can be accepted as primary (handbook open
  question 3), and whether LLM judges can be trusted on public benchmarks they may have memorised. What must hold before anyone
  reads a result: the labels are named, the labeller does not share an instrument with the metric, and unparseable outputs
  stay in the denominator. (2) WHAT CONVINCES. Item-level, threshold-free discrimination (ROC AUC) on REAL system outputs,
  compared PAIRED on the same items against the obvious baseline. The weights and threshold are frozen on one set and scored
  once on a disjoint held-out set. The result must stay stable when the label source changes. In MT metrics a win on one human-label
  protocol (MQM vs DA) is not believed until it holds on the other, and the same logic applies here. The panel labels and
  the solver labels reversed our iteration-1 ranking, so label-regime robustness IS the evidence standard for this claim.
  System-level correlation is secondary and must carry CIs. With few systems it is descriptive only. (3) STANDARD MOVES and
  what each rules out: - a paired, cluster (sentence) bootstrap: item difficulty and within-sentence dependence; - a held-out
  confirmation set scored once with frozen weights: winner's curse and threshold tuning on the test set; - nonce disguise:
  memorised-gold contamination; - meaning-preserving rewrite suites: a metric that tracks surface form; - strata by length
  and conditions: 'works only on short sentences'; - a family-disjoint adjudicator gated on expert labels: label noise passing
  as metric error; - an instrument-disjointness check between labeller and metric: circular validation; - nested cross-fitted
  ΔAUROC over the best baseline COMBINATION: 'your metric is just a re-weighting of what we have'; - tie-aware comparison
  for quantized metrics (Ties Matter). (4) USUAL FAILURE MODES. (a) Shared-instrument circularity. Our c_score shares align()
  with the solver labeller, and L2-bow shares lexical sensitivity with the panel; MT has the same problem when metrics are
  trained on the very human-judgment protocol they are scored against. (b) Comparing numbers from different label vectors.
  Iteration 1 did this with three vectors and 588 shared ids. (c) Synthetic perturbations standing in for real errors. (d)
  Tuning on the confirmation set, or subgroup hunting after a failure. (e) An LLM adjudicator from the same family as a metric
  or generator (self-preference). Gemini and Qwen are both generators and judge families in dataset E. (f) Underpowered long
  strata reported anyway. (g) Precision quoted without its prevalence. (h) Correct-but-not-equivalent outputs counted as errors,
  or, as the audit showed, 'vocabulary-aligned = CORRECT' when 58 of 59 label transitions went CORRECT->ERROR.
principle_alignment: >-
  FOLLOWS. (1) Screen/confirmation separation. PEER+TEXT features, the fusion weights and the threshold are fitted only on
  the iteration-1 screen (track L/H) and written, with a sha256, into prereg.json BEFORE any dataset-E label column is loaded.
  E is then scored once, with no subgroup hunting. (2) Paired comparison on identical ids. Every headline Δ is computed on
  the same E item_ids, with a sentence-clustered bootstrap (sentence_id). Label vectors are hashed and checked across artifacts,
  fixing iteration 1's three-vector mistake. (3) Label-regime robustness is part of the claim, not a footnote. The regimes
  are R_AB (panel tiers A+B), R_A (solver tier A), R_ADJ (a new gated reference-aware adjudicator) and R_COMP (references
  trusted by construction). The regime-shift table is a deliverable. (4) Instrument disjointness is enforced by design. Name-free
  alignment (F1) removes c_score's align() dependency on the labeller. Fusion weights are fitted only on screen items where
  the solver and panel labels AGREE, so neither confound sets the weights. (5) Contamination. Disguised versions are run for
  every LLM component, and the minimum detectable DiD is stated. (6) Invariance. ONE shared rewrite file (exp D data/invariance_items.json,
  282 rewrites) is used for every metric, so P4 compares like with like. (7) Coverage. Unparseable rows stay in the denominator
  in a pre-registered coverage view. (8) Nested ΔAUROC over S4 (all cheap baselines + judge), not just over the judge. DELIBERATELY
  BROKEN. (a) Full confirmation needs all four regimes in one artifact, but R_ADJ and R_COMP are built in parallel this iteration
  and cannot be consumed yet. So this iteration confirms under R_AB and R_A, and R_ADJ/R_COMP scoring happens in iteration
  3 by an item_id join. This stays credible because every PEER+TEXT score on E is written to disk with the prereg hash before
  those labels exist, and the adjudicator never sees any metric score. (b) The headline comparator (disguised cheap judge)
  is run twice: in the PEER+TEXT experiment, so headline (a) is computed in-iteration, and in the baseline experiment, for
  S4. The duplication is deliberate: it costs about $0.4 and yields a judge test-retest reliability number that the paper
  needs anyway. (c) R_COMP is semi-synthetic, which breaks 'real errors only'. The candidates are still REAL outputs of the
  same 10 generator slots, only the sentence is composed. It is a separate stratum, never pooled, and exists only because
  L25 tier A is untestable (the panel rejects 85% of references there). (d) Fitting on label-agreeing screen items selects
  easier items. A pre-registered sensitivity variant fitted on ALL screen items (adjudicated labels) is also frozen and reported,
  never promoted. (e) The adjudicator is an LLM, which risks circularity with the LLM metrics. It comes from a family that
  is neither generator nor metric judge. It is gated on 173 expert or known-label items, split into a dev half used for at
  most 2 prompt variants and a gate half. A second, fully family-disjoint adjudicator (xAI Grok-class) checks family independence
  on the calibration set.
title: Cheap translators plus text checks vs judges
objective: >-
  Establish PEER+TEXT as a gold-free NL->FOL faithfulness metric. PEER+TEXT is name-free, solver-graded clause consensus across
  cheap cross-family translators, fused with solver-exact text accounting. The target is a metric that beats the disguised
  cheap LLM judge (and adds over the best combination of all requested baselines) on HELD-OUT real outputs, under several
  independent label regimes. It should stay rewrite-invariant where judges flip, and name the error type, especially the dropped
  condition, on long, heavily conditioned sentences.
rationale: >-
  LATCH / DEEPEN. The object is fixed: iteration 1's two leads. Cross-family consensus reached 0.866 on solver labels but
  only 0.776 on panel labels. FOL-Triage's text layers reached 0.759 on solver labels but 0.872 on panel labels. Each beat
  the disguised cheap judge (0.777) under exactly ONE label regime. Those opposite dependencies are the diagnosis, and each
  lead has an identified shared-instrument confound. The mechanism for fusing them is already measured: peers miss 38% of
  errors, and those are the errors the medoid endorses (COVERAGE 41%, STRUCT 57%, POLARITY 5%). Text accounting sees shared
  and rename errors, and consensus sees family-specific structure errors. So all five slots attack the one object, PEER+TEXT,
  from different sides. FIX + CONFIRM (exp 1): F1 name-free alignment, F2 graded clause consensus and F3 label-agreeing calibration,
  frozen on the screen and scored once on held-out E. FAIR BAR (exp 2): every requested baseline, plus S4, re-run on E with
  the same ids, and candidate B2 executed once. CLEANER LABELS (dataset R_ADJ): a gated reference-aware adjudicator. This
  answers the confound objection a reviewer names first. BOUNDARY / REPLICATION where the user cares most (dataset R_COMP):
  long, heavily conditioned sentences whose references are trusted by construction, plus a typed-perturbation suite. MECHANISM
  PRE-TEST + MUST-FIX RECORD (evaluation): complementarity (P1/P2) on the screen with existing per-item scores, and the reviewer's
  blocking corrections computed from artifacts, not prose. Closed strands get no slot: L1 on LLM outputs, L2-role, round-trip
  re-formalisation, and the pilot metrics except as a free baseline column. SHARED DEFINITIONS (every artifact implements
  them verbatim). [E-POOL] Dataset E heldout_candidates, LLM systems only; malls_gpt4_gold and ccg2lambda rows are scored
  but reported separately. R_AB = label_tier in {A, B}, final_label in {CORRECT, ERROR}, excluding CONTESTED, reading_choice
  and UNRESOLVED. R_A = tier A only. It is testable only where the dataset card's §3 says so; everywhere else it is sign-only.
  Pooled L20+EXC+CTRL tier A is the R_A headline. PRIMARY = parseable rows. COVERAGE VIEW = UNPARSEABLE rows added as ERROR,
  with each metric's pre-declared fallback score (PEER+TEXT: p=1). Bootstrap: 2,000 resamples clustered by metadata sentence_id,
  seed 0. Strata: source_stratum L25/L20/EXC/CTRL, and words/n_quant/depth/n_conditions/exception_type from metadata. Untestable
  cells (<50/50) are declared before scoring. [SCREEN] Exp A's screen_items.json/href_items.json item_ids. Labels are exp
  A's solver labels, plus dataset E's screen_adjudicated_labels.json (1,173 rows). 'Label-agreeing' = solver final label ==
  adjudicated final_label, tiers A/B/auto_only. [REWRITES] Exp D data/invariance_items.json (282 rewrites: RENAME 150, REORDER
  41, DEMORGAN 39, CONTRAPOSITIVE 39, REPRINT 12, PRENEX 1). The judges' scores on it already exist in exp D results/rewrite_scores.jsonl,
  and every new metric scores exactly these rw_ids. [ADJ-PROMPT] The adjudicator sees the ORIGINAL sentence, the candidate
  FOL, and a reference FOL tagged VERIFIED or UNVERIFIED. It is told that predicate names and decomposition may legitimately
  differ and that it must judge meaning only. It returns JSON: {verdict: FAITHFUL | UNFAITHFUL | AMBIGUOUS_READING, ops: subset
  of [NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE, MEANING_RENAME, OTHER], location: short span
  of the sentence, reference_wrong: bool}. Settings: temperature 0, no reasoning trace requested, and one fixed prompt text
  released as adjudication_prompt.txt. Dataset R_COMP copies the same spec verbatim. POSITIVE TARGET. The paper's lead sentence
  if it holds: 'agreement among cheap translators, graded clause-by-clause by a solver with name-free alignment, fused with
  solver-exact text accounting, beats a disguised LLM judge on held-out real outputs under both panel and solver labels, and
  stays rewrite-invariant where judges flip.' If only one regime holds, the regime-shift table becomes the finding. That is
  still a positive methodological result, because it quantifies how much label choice alone moves metric rankings. The per-type
  crossover (P1) tells the user which cheap signal owns which error mass, whatever the headline.

    Copy the code; do not reimplement the judge prompt or the disguise. STEP 0: freeze everything below in prereg.json with
    sha256 and a timestamp BEFORE any E label field is read. Implement this as two scripts: score_E.py gets E rows with the
    label fields deleted, and analyse_E.py refuses to run unless prereg.sha256 exists and is older than the scores file. F1
    name_free_align(cand_fol, peer_fol, text=None). Build a signature per predicate and constant: arity; z3 monotonicity polarity
    of each occurrence (DOWN/UP/MIXED); quantifier block index and force; argument-sharing graph (which variables and slots
    it co-occurs with); and an optional text anchor (the L2 stem/WordNet span it matches in the sentence). Solve an assignment
    (Hungarian on signature distance, then the top-k ≤5 alternative assignments). ACCEPT the mapping that maximises the number
    of verified clause entailments under it. Names never enter the cost except through the optional anchor term. Pre-register
    two variants: NF-pure (no anchor) and NF-anchored (the anchor as a soft cost). Select ONE on the screen by this rule:
    highest screen AUROC among variants with RENAME FA ≤0.10 on the shared rewrite set. Over-alignment is measured by a MEANING_RENAME
    probe: on screen CORRECT items, replace one predicate by a different same-arity predicate from the same story, 150 items,
    sha1-seeded. Report recall on that probe and on SWAP. F2 graded_consensus(text, fol, peers) -> {g_score, support, coverage,
    unit_codes, n_unknown}. Claim units are top-level conjuncts after NNF/prenex normalisation, each universal rule split
    as (restrictor set -> consequent), plus existential claims. support = the mean over candidate units of the fraction of
    peers entailing the unit under the NF map. coverage = the fraction of peer-majority units (supported by ≥50% of peers)
    that the candidate entails. g_score = 1 - F1(support, coverage). unit_codes: an unsupported unit is ADD; an uncovered
    majority unit is DROP (with its location); candidate entails the negation of a majority unit = NEG; match only after a
    ∀/∃ flip = QUANT; match only after argument permutation = SWAP. The medoid-repair operators (exp C) are kept as a second
    readout. Peers are leave-one-FAMILY-out. On E the peers are the other generator slots of the same sentence; Llama-70B
    and Qwen3 zero-shot rows are the same family as their few-shot slots. malls_gpt4_gold and ccg2lambda are never peers.
    On the screen the peers are exp C's 6 fresh peers plus the 2 other Logic-LM systems. A z3 timeout (2 s) makes the unit
    UNKNOWN, excluded from both means, and n_unknown is reported. Report g_score also with peers subsampled to k=6, a pre-registered
    pool-size sensitivity check, since the screen and E pools differ. Also compute c_score_nf (exact equivalence under the
    NF map) and c_score_align (the iteration-1 method, as a reference column). TEXT SIDE: content_accounting (L2-bow) and
    role_questionnaire + l3_compare (L3-z3) from exp A's fol_triage.py, unchanged, using gemini-2.5-flash-lite with text only.
    On E that is 700 sentences plus their disguised versions, about $0.3. L1 and L2-role are emitted as columns only (closed
    strands, no tuning). F3 FUSION peer_text_score(text, fol, peers): logistic regression on [g_score, c_score_nf, L2-bow,
    L3-z3], standardised with screen statistics. Fit it on screen L+H items where the solver label and the adjudicated label
    AGREE, with 5 sentence-grouped folds to pick C from {0.1, 1, 10}. The final fit uses all agreeing items. Set the threshold
    to FA = 0.10 on screen CORRECT items from LLM systems only. The frozen sensitivity variant is fitted on ALL screen items
    with adjudicated labels. Also freeze single-signal PEER (g_score) and TEXT (L2-bow+L3 logistic) so P1/P2 can be run. COMPARATOR
    on E: judge_cheap_disg with exp D's exact rubric-A prompt and disguise code on all E LLM rows. Also run judge_cheap_orig
    on the same rows (~7.4k × 2 calls, ≈$0.8), and log $ per call. ANALYSIS (analyse_E.py, after the prereg check). (a) Paired

    among true errors. Decompose the fusion's AUROC gain over the better single signal into the parts from peer-endorsed and
    non-endorsed errors. (d) P3: logistic interactions of score × z(words) for c_score_nf, g_score, fused and judge. Report
    fused-minus-judge Δ by stratum. (e) P4: FA and flip rate per rewrite family on the SHARED rewrite set for g_score, c_score_nf,
    L2-bow, L3 and fused, next to the judge rows from exp D rewrite_scores.jsonl. (f) Error-type readout accuracy: unit_codes
    and medoid ops vs tier-A repair_ops on 1-2-op errors, against chance and against the judge's type label. (g) System-level
    Kendall τ with bootstrap CI over the 13 system×variant rows, for fused and for the judge, against R_AB error rates. (h)
    Complexity curves (AUROC and FA vs words, n_quant, depth, n_conditions, exception_type). (i) Contamination: original vs
    disguised for L3 and the judge, paired, with the minimum detectable DiD stated. (j) Coverage (all failures in the denominator)
    and $ and seconds per item. Per-item output keyed by E item_id: all component scores, the fused p, fired signal, unit_codes,
    n_unknown and cost. This is what iteration 3 joins with R_ADJ and R_COMP. COMPUTE. z3 work runs in a ProcessPool on 7
    vCPUs with a pair cache keyed by (sha1(cand), sha1(peer)). Scale mini (20 sentences) -> 100 -> all per aii-long-running-tasks.

    Re-run EVERY requested baseline on dataset E with the same item_ids and label regimes, so PEER+TEXT has a fair bar and
    iteration 3 can compute the nested ΔAUROC over S4. The baselines are parse rate, the pilot structural metrics, round-trip
    NLI (API and local verbaliser) and embedding similarity, the cheap judge (original and disguised), the frontier judge
    (original and disguised, stratified 300), SC-5, and the cross-fitted S4. Also execute candidate B2 (solver-built worlds

    before reading E labels, as in the PEER+TEXT experiment. BASELINES on all E LLM rows. (1) parse_ok, with unparseable rows
    as errors in the coverage view. (2) Pilot structural metrics, CPU only, no tuning. The 'document' is the (system, story)
    for CTRL rows and the (system, source_stratum, sha1-bucket of 20 sentences) for MALLS rows; log this as an adaptation.
    Rerun Jaccard uses the zero-shot vs few-shot variants of Llama-70B/Qwen3 where both exist, and other slots as proxies
    elsewhere, logged. (3) Round-trip: the cheap verbaliser (the exp D model) plus local verbaliser, then DeBERTa-v3-large
    NLI in both directions and all-mpnet cosine, on GPU. rt_reformalise_eq is CLOSED and is not re-run. (4) judge_cheap orig
    + disg (gemini-2.5-flash-lite, rubric A) and judge_cheap2 (gpt-4.1-nano) disg, all with the error-type label. (5) judge_strong
    = the frontier model exp D used (gemini-3.1-pro-preview, or its current successor if retired, logged), original and disguised,
    on a 300-row sample stratified by R_AB label × source_stratum, seed 0. Record $ per call and check it against the $0.002
    gate. (6) SC-5: 5 samples at T=0.7 from gpt-4.1-nano per E sentence (≈3.5k calls), with the candidate scored as the fraction
    of samples equivalent modulo vocab, as in iteration 1. (7) S4 = the cross-fitted logistic regression of all cheap baselines
    INCLUDING the judge, with 5 folds grouped by sentence_id, seed 0. Emit the OOF score per item and the fold ids (folds_E.json)
    so iteration 3 can nest PEER+TEXT on the identical folds. B2 world_probe(text, fol). Build typed single-edit mutants of
    the candidate with the census operators (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, DROP, SWAP, SCOPE; ≤6 per item, sha1-seeded; reuse
    repair_census.py). For each non-equivalent mutant ψ, z3 finds a model of φ∧¬ψ over ≤4 named individuals (and optionally
    ψ∧¬φ). The model restricted to φ's predicates is verbalised by fixed template (camelCase split, slot order kept). A text-only
    reader (gemini-2.5-flash-lite, which never sees a formula) answers TRUE/FALSE/UNDETERMINED for 'is the sentence true in
    this situation?'. Score = the fraction of worlds where the reader's verdict disagrees with φ's truth value. The UNDETERMINED
    share is reported separately as the dropped-condition signal. GATE: reader accuracy on worlds built from tier-A CORRECT
    references, where truth is known exactly, ≥0.85, reported by stratum. Run B2 on screen L+H first (so iteration 3 can fit
    it as a 5th fusion feature on the screen only), then on E LLM rows in sha1 order until the $2 cap. The covered subset
    is logged. If it fails to run, record why; it is then dropped for good. ANALYSES. (a) AUROC/AUPRC with sentence-clustered
    CIs for every baseline under R_AB and R_A, pooled and per stratum. (b) Paired Δs vs judge_cheap_disg with DeLong p. (c)
    The frontier-vs-cheap paired Δ on the 300 rows, original and disguised, plus the cost ratio. (d) Contamination DiD for
    every LLM component, with the minimum detectable DiD computed from the bootstrap SE. (e) Judge recall at MATCHED FA (orig
    vs disg) per error type: this corrects iteration 1's 'reads more carefully' claim. (f) Complexity curves and a judge-correctness
    × length logistic regression. (g) Coverage and $ and seconds per item per metric. (h) Gold-error and correct-but-not-equivalent
    rates under R_AB, per stratum and per system, from E metadata. (i) System-level Kendall τ over the 13 system×variant rows
    with CIs. Budget: estimate before each sweep. Cheap judges about $1.1, frontier about $1.8-2.5, SC about $0.5, verbaliser
    about $0.4, B2 $2; hard stop at $9.5, tracked after every call. Output: per-item rows keyed by E item_id with every baseline

    price. It is disjoint from all 9 generator families and from the Gemini/OpenAI metric judges. CAVEAT to record: the same
    family as panel member Haiku-4.5, which wrote the PANEL_REPAIRED references. Family-independence check: an xAI Grok-class
    model (disjoint from generators, judges AND panel) is run on the calibration set only. PROMPT = the ADJ-PROMPT spec in
    the strategy rationale, verbatim, saved as adjudication_prompt.txt. Temperature 0. Items are NOT disguised (meaning matters).
    Reference tagged VERIFIED for tier A/GOLD_PANEL_OK/TRUSTED_AGREED/curated, UNVERIFIED otherwise. GATE PROTOCOL. Split
    the 173 calibration items into dev and gate halves (sha1, stratified by faithful/unfaithful). At most 2 prompt variants
    are compared on dev, and the chosen one is frozen. The gate runs on the gate half: balanced accuracy ≥0.85, and ≥0.80
    separately on faithful and on unfaithful items. Also report it on the full 173 set, plus a test-retest on 100 items. If
    Sonnet fails and Grok passes, Grok becomes R_ADJ. If both fail, R_ADJ is dropped and that is reported with the numbers,
    and the remaining budget goes to more R_ADJ-style dual labelling of disagreements, so the disagreement set is still characterised.
    SAMPLE (≤1,200 E rows, LLM systems, sha1-ordered within cells, the sampling frame frozen in a file before any call): (i)
    EVERY row where solver auto_label and panel majority disagree; (ii) tier-B VOCAB_GRAN and COMPOUND rows oversampled; (iii)
    an L25 oversample; (iv) a 150-row tier-C slice with UNVERIFIED references, so iteration 3 can see how tier C behaves;
    (v) a 150-row random slice of tier-A CORRECT/ERROR, which gives the solver labeller's precision and recall vs R_ADJ. Record
    inclusion probabilities, so pooled R_ADJ estimates can be inverse-probability weighted in iteration 3. SCREEN: adjudicate
    all screen items (track L+H) where exp A's solver label ≠ screen_adjudicated final_label (~70-130), plus a 60-item agreeing
    control. OUTPUT rows {input: {text, candidate_fol, reference_fol, reference_status}, output: R_ADJ label (CORRECT/ERROR/AMBIGUOUS_READING),

    cross-tabs; label-transition counts per stratum; correct-but-not-equivalent and gold-error (reference_wrong) rates under
    R_ADJ vs R_AB per stratum and per system (iteration-1 R_AB values: 0.16-0.26 per stratum, panel gold-error 0.82); the
    error-type census under R_ADJ (prediction: polarity ≤20%, coverage ≥40%) with bootstrap CIs; and the adjudicator's agreement
    with tier-A solver labels. The adjudicator never sees any metric score. Budget: ≈700 input + 150 output tokens per call
    (≈$0.0045 for Sonnet-class). About 1,450 calls ≈ $6.5 plus about $0.5 for the Grok check. Hard stop $9.5, tracked after

    heldout_sentences with reference_status TRUSTED_AGREED or GOLD_PANEL_OK, plus E CTRL references. Add further FOLIO-v2-train

    and labeller/). Prefer universal rules with 1-2 restrictor conditions that share a variable sort (e.g., people, animals,
    students) so they compose naturally. COMPOSITION TEMPLATES (fixed, ≥8 surface variants, sha1-seeded). (i) Conjoin 2-3
    rules' conditions: 'If a person is A and B, and they C, then ...'. (ii) Exception: 'X unless E', 'X except when E', 'X
    provided that P', 'X, but only if P'. (iii) Nested: 'Every A who B, provided that C, D unless E'. Gold is derived compositionally,
    in a WEAK exception reading (A∧¬E→X) and a STRONG reading (A→(X↔¬E)) where applicable. Both are stored, and a candidate
    matching either is CORRECT. Filter to ≥25 words and ≥3 conditions (the same counters as E's strata). Grammar check: reject
    sentences whose template fill leaves agreement errors. A cheap LLM fluency rating (1-5) on all items drops any with rating
    <3, and the ratings are reported. The composition is also recorded as 'text-level provenance': for each composed sentence,
    the list of source rules and the template id. CANDIDATES: the same fixed few-shot prompt (/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1/prompts/fewshot_v1.txt),

    repair_census.py), against both readings. CORRECT = equivalent (modulo vocab) to either reading; ERROR = non-equivalent
    with a found repair (ops recorded); VOCAB_GRAN and COMPOUND go to adjudication with the shared ADJ-PROMPT (verbatim from
    the strategy rationale; Anthropic Sonnet-class; reference tagged VERIFIED), capped at $2.5, with verdict and ops stored.
    UNPARSEABLE is kept. Testability of R_COMP (≥50 CORRECT and ≥50 ERROR rows over ≥25 sentences each) is declared in the
    card before any metric runs. If the CORRECT count falls short after 250 sentences, compose a pre-registered top-up of
    100 simpler-template sentences (≥25 words, 3 conditions, no nesting). TYPED-PERTURBATION SUITE (for the user's per-type
    sensitivity requirement). Base it on ≤200 tier-A-verified references from E (GOLD_PANEL_OK/TRUSTED_AGREED/CTRL) plus 100
    R_COMP references. Apply the 12 census operators (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE),
    plus MEANING_RENAME: substitute a same-arity predicate taken from another sentence's vocabulary. Operators are applied
    at matched DOWN vs UP positions (z3 monotonicity), and each perturbed formula is verified non-equivalent to its base by
    z3. Also include 3 STRICT meaning-preserving rewrites per base (RENAME by WordNet synonym/nonce, REORDER, CONTRAPOSITIVE)
    as known-faithful controls. Every perturbation row carries its base item id, operator, position polarity and sentence_id.
    OUTPUT: rows {input: {text, candidate_fol, reference_fol_weak, reference_fol_strong, system, prompt_variant}, output:

    (E's disguise.py)}. Also emit a peers file: all generator outputs per R_COMP sentence, so the graded consensus can run
    in iteration 3 without new calls. Card: label counts per template and exception type, weak-vs-strong reading acceptance,
    the fluency distribution, the testability declaration and costs. Hard stop $9.5. Use aii-json for full/mini/preview. NOTE

  After this iteration: (1) PEER+TEXT is frozen on the screen (prereg hash) and scored once on all dataset-E LLM rows. The
  headline paired Δ vs the disguised cheap judge is available under R_AB and R_A, pooled and per stratum. P1-P4 are each scored
  CONFIRMED or REFUTED. Released functions: name_free_align, graded_consensus, peer_text_score. (2) Every requested baseline
  is on the same E ids, with S4 OOF and fold ids, the frontier judge's same-item gain and its cost, the contamination MDEs,
  and B2's first real execution. (3) R_ADJ: a gated, family-independent, reference-aware adjudication of about 1,200 E rows
  plus the screen's disagreement items, with regime-transition tables and gold-error / correct-but-not-equivalent rates. (4)
  R_COMP: a powered long, conditioned, exception stratum with references trusted by construction, real outputs from 10 generators,
  and a typed-perturbation suite with MEANING_RENAME. (5) A file-verified correction of every blocking iteration-1 claim,
  plus the screen-side mechanism pre-test. Iteration 3 then needs only one join-and-score EVALUATION: criteria (a) under R_ADJ,
  (b) nested over S4 on identical folds, and (c) on R_COMP and the long strata, with PEER+TEXT (+B2 if gated) weights still
  frozen. Expected ranking going in, stated so a surprise is visible: PEER+TEXT beats the judge under R_AB (the text half
  is strong on panel labels) and ties or slightly wins under R_A. The margin is larger in L25/L20/EXC than in CTRL. If PEER+TEXT
  loses under every regime, the judge is the user's incumbent, and the crossover table plus the regime-shift table become
  the paper's findings.
summary: >-
  Deepen iteration: all five slots attack one object, PEER+TEXT, which fuses solver-graded, name-free cross-family consensus
  with solver-exact text accounting. Exp 1 fixes the three measured defects (renaming, length saturation, false-alarm calibration),
  freezes on the screen and confirms once on held-out E against the disguised judge, testing the crossover, disjointness,
  length and invariance mechanisms. Exp 2 puts every requested baseline plus S4 on the same E ids and executes the never-run
  solver-worlds candidate once. Two datasets add the label regimes that decide the claim: a gated reference-aware adjudicator,
  and a composed-long stratum with trusted-by-construction references plus typed perturbations. An evaluation turns the reviewer's
  blocking corrections and the screen-side complementarity pre-test into verified numbers.

<dependency_rules>
- depends_on is a list of objects {id, label} — each entry references an existing artifact and tags how it is being used
- "id" can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts> — never IDs you are proposing (all new artifacts run in parallel)
- "label" is a SHORT free-text type label (a word or two, NOT a sentence) describing what role the dep plays — e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends", "supersedes". Required on every dep.
- Setting depends_on provides the dependency's out_dependency_files to your artifact at execution time
- If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use empty depends_on
- New artifact IDs are assigned by the system after submission — do not invent IDs for your proposed artifacts

<compute_hardware>
This planning session's own shell (if you inspect it, e.g. via aii-use-hardware or nproc) is a lightweight pod and is NOT what any artifact executes on. Each artifact you direct runs LATER on its own separately-provisioned pod, sized by artifact type:

  - research: cpu_basic (4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM — proofs, research, lightweight tasks)
  - experiment: gpu_basic (1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models), cpu_plus (4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing)
  - dataset: gpu_basic (1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models), cpu_plus (4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing)
  - evaluation: gpu_basic (1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models), cpu_plus (4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing)
  - proof: cpu_basic (4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM — proofs, research, lightweight tasks)

Size scale decisions (panel/sweep counts, model counts, etc.) against these tiers, not against this planning session's own hardware.
</compute_hardware>

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks. When a power analysis or the effect sizes already on record show the panel underpowered for the effect being chased, spend the plan's budget on more graded samples or checkpoints, not on more candidate metrics — a wider panel of readouts over the same underpowered set proves nothing new.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

title: Do other models' translations agree? Consensus metric for NL-to-logic
summary: >-
  Experiment 3 screens candidate C, a text-free, gold-free consensus metric for NL->FOL faithfulness, on the shared frozen
  screen (label hash 0e43cbdd...). c_score = 1 - eq_frac: the share of OTHER systems' translations of the same sentence that
  are NOT z3-equivalent to the candidate modulo vocabulary alignment. The pool has 6 fresh OpenRouter families (llama-3.3-70b,
  qwen3-235b, deepseek-v3.1, mistral-small-3.2, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gpt-4.1-mini) plus the 3 released Logic-LM systems,
  leave-one-out. Also scored: medoid repair depth and operators, and semantic entropy over z3 classes. Baselines: K=5 self-consistency
  (gpt-4.1-nano T=0.7 on all items; true same-model gpt-3.5-turbo SC for gpt-3.5 candidates), predicate-set stability, and
  FOL length. PRIMARY (track L, 297 CORRECT vs 249 ERROR, sentence-clustered bootstrap 2000): c_score AUROC 0.866 [0.821,
  0.906]; peers-only 0.872; non-OpenAI peers 0.863; other Logic-LM systems only 0.753; cluster entropy 0.773; medoid depth

  - sc5_same = +0.140 [0.057, 0.227] (n=167). Cross-fitted [c_score, sc5] vs [sc5] = +0.147. Vocab-clean subset (shared-aligner
  confound control): c_score 0.852 vs SC 0.714. At the medoid threshold: recall 0.62, false alarms 0.14. Shared blind spot:
  38% of errors are endorsed by the consensus (POLARITY 5%, COVERAGE 41%, STRUCT 57%). Repair operators match the labeller's
  81% of the time (chance 46%). RENAME rewrites cause 96% false alarms (the aligner does not survive synonym or constant renaming);
  z3-equivalent rewrites flip 0% by construction. Long/conditioned stratum n=5, descriptive only. Cost: $1.52 total; the peer
  pool costs $0.0015 per sentence. This re-run completed the SC_cheap arm that the shared-key limit had cut to 231/307 units,
  and restored WordNet for RENAME.

  FOLIO-dev outputs labelled vs corrected gold or agreed premises: 294 CORRECT / 230 ERROR / 216 UNCERTAIN / 56 UNPARSEABLE.
  Track H = 294 curated original-vs-corrected items. Label-vector sha1 122d01df... FINAL judges are the planned API models,

  verbaliser) / 0.740 (local verbaliser); rt_embed_cos 0.633; rt_reformalise_eq 0.513 (near chance). User's pilot structural
  metrics are 0.50-0.53 (a negative result); cross-system rerun Jaccard 0.720. The cross-fitted S4 combination of all cheap
  baselines has OOF AUROC 0.817 [0.762, 0.867], which is +0.039 [-0.010, 0.087] over the judge (not significant). best_baseline_oof
  per item and data/folds.json are provided for nested deltas in iteration 2. Contamination: no evidence. Every DiD CI includes
  0; the frontier judge loses ~0.07 under disguise on both tracks (lost lexical meaning); the recall probe matches the corrected
  gold 15.9% vs the erroneous original 4.4%. Invariance: the judges false-alarm on contrapositive (cheap 0.67, nano 0.97),
  De Morgan and rename rewrites. Judge correctness falls with sentence length (p=1.6e-5); long sentences are untestable on
  track L. Label noise: 56% of L ERRORs are subst_only; results/judge_label_disagreements.csv is there for dataset-E adjudication.
  All headline numbers were re-derived independently, with placebos, in results/audit_headlines.json. Outputs: method_out.json

title: Held-out logic translation test set, panel-checked
summary: >-
  Held-out NL->FOL faithfulness meta-evaluation set (run_u75jRHUss0zo, iter 1, dataset E). full_data_out.json (exp_sel_data_out,
  27.7 MB) has 4 groups. (1) heldout_candidates: 8,507 rows = real FOL candidates for 700 screen-disjoint sentences. Strata:
  MALLS-train L25=300 (>=25 words, >=3 conditions; includes a pre-registered 100-sentence top-up), L20=150, EXC=100 (unless/except/without),
  and FOLIO-train CTRL=150. Generators: 10 LLM slots over 9 families, few-shot at temperature 0; zero-shot Llama-70B/Qwen3;
  GPT-5.1 on 200 sentences; ccg2lambda; the MALLS GPT-4 gold as a system. input=JSON{text,candidate_fol,reference_fol,system,prompt_variant};
  output=CORRECT/ERROR/CONTESTED/UNRESOLVED/UNPARSEABLE. Labels combine the shared z3 solver labeller with a blind, nonce-disguised,
  family-disjoint panel (Haiku-4.5/GLM-4.6/Kimi-K2; Haiku adjudicates only GLM/Kimi disagreements). The combination rule gives
  tier A (solver), B (panel-decided VOCAB_GRAN/COMPOUND) and C (no trusted reference). Metadata per row: sentence_id (bootstrap
  cluster), item_id, strata {words,n_quant,depth,n_conditions,exception_type,source_stratum,l25_topup_batch}, auto_label,
  repair_ops, panel_votes, error_ops, label_tier, reference_status, correct_not_equivalent, reading_choice, disguised_text/fol.
  Tier A+B testable: L25 176 CORRECT/697 ERROR; L20, EXC and CTRL are also testable. (2) heldout_sentences: 700 rows with
  reference status (GOLD_PANEL_OK 95, PANEL_REPAIRED 145, NO_TRUSTED_REFERENCE 295, TRUSTED_AGREED 36, DISPUTED 112). (3)
  panel_calibration: 77 synthetic gate items plus 96 expert track-H real-error pairs with panel votes. (4) screen_audit: 1,173
  Logic-LM track-L and curated track-H rows keyed by the screen's item_id; also in screen_adjudicated_labels.json. Caveats:
  the panel is STRICT. Its majority accuracy on real errors is 0.727, and it accepts only 0.61 of expert-corrected formulas.
  It rejected 82% of MALLS gold, so ERROR is over-called: confirm on tier A too. HELD-OUT: iteration 2 must not tune thresholds
  on it. Primary analysis = tiers A+B excluding CONTESTED and reading_choice, bootstrapped by sentence_id. See dataset_card.md.
  Cost $9.83.

  Held-out confirmation of PEER+TEXT (NL->FOL faithfulness without gold) on dataset E (8,507 candidate rows, 700 sentences),
  frozen on the iteration-1 screen (prereg sha256 b9f28b1b, git a6896ce) and scored once. PEER = graded cross-family consensus
  (claim units, peer aligned into candidate vocabulary, finite-model refuter + z3 entailment; support/coverage/g_score, unit

  judge bar is UNTESTABLE (shared OpenRouter key hit $0 at 18:00 UTC; the replacement key was also exhausted, polled 19:10-22:13
  UTC; 20 rows); the local judge is a labelled secondary bar. Fusion does NOT beat c_score_align alone (stratified +.011 n.s.;
  tier A c_score_align .860 > .818), and that aligner is shared with the solver labeller (confound open). Name-free alignment
  'failed' the screen gate only through a threshold-tie artefact; post hoc NF-anchored passes (RENAME FA .074, ROLE_PERMUTE

title: Long logic sentences and FOL error suite
summary: >-
  Two held-out NL->FOL faithfulness tables (full_data_out.json, aii exp_sel_data_out, every row re-verified against its sources
  by data.py and z3-re-verified by src/verify.py, 0 failures). (1) PERTURB (group perturb_suite, COMPLETE): 4,234 typed mutants
  (metadata_fold PERTURB, output ERROR, error_ops=[op]) plus 868 meaning-preserving controls (PERTURB_CONTROL, output CORRECT).
  They cover 300 bases: 36 TRUSTED_AGREED + 95 GOLD_PANEL_OK + 69 PANEL_REPAIRED dataset-E references, and 100 R_COMP weak
  readings. Operators are NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD (ADD_FOREIGN / ADD_INTERNAL), SWAP, BIND and MEANING_RENAME,
  at DOWN/UP positions (metadata_position_polarity, polarity_method, matched_pair_id; 1,354 complete pairs). QUANT/REV/RESTR
  are UP-only; SCOPE and UNGLUE have 0 rows. Each mutant is z3 non-equivalent to every accepted reading. Controls are RENAME_SYN
  / RENAME_NONCE, REORDER and CONTRAPOSITIVE/DEMORGAN, each z3-equivalent. (2) R_COMP (group rcomp_sentences): 250 main +
  100 reserve templated sentences, each with >=25 words, >=3 conditions and one unless/except/provided-that/only-if clause
  (9 templates). Weak and strong references come from the template (T8 also stores a not-accepted converse), are unit-tested
  and z3-checked, and are built from a 652-entry atom lexicon mined from verified FOLIO/MALLS references. Provenance fields:
  template_id, lexicon_ids, source_rule_ids. CAVEAT: the shared OpenRouter key hit its daily limit 5 minutes in ($0.41 spent);
  the 21:38 UTC replacement key was also already exhausted. Pending: the Sonnet lexicon and reference audits, fluency, generator
  candidates (rcomp_candidates), solver labels, adjudication and the testability declaration. ./run_all.sh completes them
  resumably under the pre-registered prereg_rcomp.json. Until then R_COMP must not be used for metric claims. PERTURB is ready
  for per-operator sensitivity and invariance analysis. Rows carry item_id (E's recipe) and disguised_text/fol. adjudicator_check_out.json
  holds 60 known-label QA items. See dataset_card.md.

title: Re-checking earlier logic-metric results across label sets
summary: >-
  Zero-LLM-spend, CPU-only re-analysis of the iteration-1 artifacts (exp A FOL-Triage, exp C consensus c_score, exp D judges/baselines,
  dataset E screen adjudication), joined on item_id. eval.py (+src/) writes eval_out.json (exp_eval_sol_out, validated; ~5.9k
  flat metrics_agg keys + structured metadata incl. VERDICT; 1,380 per-item examples with oriented scores, per-regime labels,
  PT OOF), tables/*.csv (each with a '# source:' line), figures/fig_regime_shift and fig_forest_common (json/png/pdf), and
  audit/ scripts. KEY FINDINGS. (1) Re-derivation gate: 57/57 reviewer audit numbers reproduce (n=389/160 err/151 sents; c_score
  .842, fused .767, judge_disg .785; tier A+B n=304 fused .872, bow .817, c_score .776, judge .771). (2) Same-item, same-label
  common sets for 13 regimes (testable: R_SOLVER_CONS n=373/155 err, own-label A/C/D, R_ADJ_AB 298/165, R_ADJ_ALL 498/271,
  CONTESTED->C/E, L_UNPARSEABLE_AS_ERROR 413/195; R_ADJ_A and all track-H regimes are untestable, reported sign-only). (3)
  The iteration-1 rule FAILS for fused_H and c_score in every regime (rewrite FA 0.275 / 0.96). fused_H minus judge is -0.013
  under solver labels but +0.096 [.020,.171] under A+B; c_score minus judge is +0.067 [-.012,.148] under solver labels and
  +0.006 under A+B. (4) Label-only shift solver->A+B on the same 161 items: bow +0.102 and fused +0.080 (CI>0) go up; c_score
  -0.106 goes down. Rank Kendall tau is 0.60. On the 58 flipped items, bow/fused flag 81-83% vs c_score 34% (instrument-sharing
  confirmed). (5) SCREEN PREVIEW: PT (cross-fitted c_score+bow_uncarried+l3) minus judge_cheap_disg is +0.089 [.010,.165]
  solver, +0.104 [.039,.175] A+B, +0.090 [.038,.142] all tiers, +0.118 unparseable-as-error. Nested S4+PT over refit S4 is
  +0.04-0.06 (CI>0). Screen bar that iteration-2 confirmation must beat = these deltas. (6) P1: the structural clause is untestable
  (all QUANT/SCOPE/BIND/SWAP/NEG cells have <15 errors); text beats peers on peer-endorsed errors (CI>0). P2a CONFIRMED only
  for all tiers. P2b depends on the comparator: vs c_score the gain comes from endorsed errors; vs bow it comes from non-endorsed
  errors. (7) At matched FA 0.10 the ORIGINAL cheap judge has higher recall than the disguised one (+0.11/+0.20). Contamination
  DiD CIs include 0 but MDE = 0.12-0.21, so a 0.05 effect is undetectable. Frontier minus cheap under A+B is +0.166. (8) Invariance
  comparisons across A/C/D used different rewrite sets. (9) Candidate B was planned but gen_art_experiment_2 is an empty .aii/
  dir: it never ran. (10) Exp C's -0.94/SD length interaction reproduces exactly. Exp A's L2-bow = n_unanch+uncarried (0.737)
  vs bow_uncarried (0.711). Panel expert-pair acceptance is .613 (unambiguous). Independent re-derivation (different code
  path) matches all headline numbers. On permuted labels the cross-fitted PT is biased below 0.5; the observed deltas exceed
  all 20 null deltas (null max .047 solver / .087 A+B).

# Gold-Free Faithfulness Metrics for NL-to-FOL Translation

## Framing

Translating natural language into first-order logic (NL-FOL) is a prerequisite for neurosymbolic reasoning pipelines [10], yet evaluating whether a candidate formula faithfully captures a sentence's meaning remains an open problem. Gold FOL annotations are expensive, non-unique, and unreliable: Brunello et al. [3] found that approximately 42% of entries in both FOLIO [1] and MALLS [2] contain incorrect formalisations. Existing metrics either require a gold formula (exact match, prover-checked equivalence) or only verify that the output parses [5, 6]. The user's own pilot study used structural consistency checks (arity agreement, predicate-set overlap across reruns, joint satisfiability) that measure stability but not whether a formula says what its sentence says.

This run investigates gold-free metrics that predict faithfulness to the text given only a sentence and a candidate formula, with no reference formula, no ontology, and no domain knowledge. The evaluation is a meta-evaluation: we build a labelled set of (sentence, formula) pairs from public benchmarks whose gold has been audited, and measure each metric's ability to discriminate correct translations from errors.

## Iteration 1

### 1.1 Strategy

The iteration screens four candidate metric families head-to-head on a frozen evaluation set, with a disguised cheap LLM judge as the bar to beat.

**Candidates.** (A) FOL-Triage, a three-layer cascade: L1 (formula lint: deterministic formula smells), L2 (text accounting: bag-of-words and role-aware coverage), and L3 (role questionnaire: a small LLM reads the text and z3 reads the formula; their structured answers are compared). (B) Round-trip verification: verbalise the formula back to natural language and compare to the original via NLI or embedding similarity [7]. (C) Cross-system consensus: collect translations of the same sentence from multiple independent systems, measure z3-equivalence between the candidate and the peer pool, and score disagreement [8]. (D) Disguised cheap judge and baselines: an LLM judge, structural pilot metrics, and round-trip features evaluated on nonce-disguised sentences to control for memorisation.

**Evaluation set.** The frozen screen uses Logic-LM [10] released outputs on FOLIO validation: three LLM systems (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, text-davinci-003) producing 796 items. Track L contains LLM outputs labelled by z3 equivalence to corrected gold [4]; track H contains the 294 original human gold formulas, of which 57 are errors according to the corrected labels. The parallel run (run_qY2a2IS-WLIs) measured 43.9% of solver-non-equivalent candidates as faithful by a three-family panel; iteration 2 will re-score with those adjudicated labels.

**Decision rule.** A candidate must achieve AUROC ≥ 0.65 on track L (ERROR vs CORRECT), with coverage ≥ 90%, rewrite false-alarm rate ≤ 10% per rewrite family, and cost ≤ $0.002 per item. It advances only if its AUROC exceeds the disguised cheap judge's, with a paired bootstrap CI excluding zero.

**Held-out dataset (Artifact E).** A separate 700-sentence, 8,507-row held-out set was constructed from FOLIO training premises, MALLS training long/conditional/exception strata, and FOLIO curated conclusions, each translated by 9 LLM families plus ccg2lambda plus GPT-4 gold. Labels were assigned by z3 equivalence to audited gold, with contested cases adjudicated by a three-member panel (Claude Haiku-4.5, GLM-4.6, Kimi-K2). This set is reserved for iteration 2 confirmation. [ARTIFACT:art_U4Hsqt4Ay9Tg]

The dataset contains 1,750 CORRECT, 5,005 ERROR, 1,086 UNPARSEABLE, 276 UNRESOLVED, and 390 CONTESTED items. The panel calibration subset (173 items) shows that the panel agrees with expert-corrected labels on both faithful and unfaithful items. A screen audit of 1,173 items from the Logic-LM screen confirms the label assignment. The dataset cost $9.83 in API calls.

### 1.2 Experiment A: FOL-Triage

[ARTIFACT:art_d0njuqy2Csj-]

FOL-Triage was evaluated on the frozen screen with Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite as the primary LLM for L3. Total API spend was $0.29.

#### Headline AUROCs (track L, ERROR vs CORRECT, n = 477, 199 errors)

| Metric | AUROC | 95% CI | AUPRC |
|-|-|-|-|
| L1 (any smell) | 0.508 | [0.499, 0.519] | 0.425 |
| L2 bag-of-words | 0.737 | [0.677, 0.801] | 0.690 |
| L2 role-aware | 0.557 | [0.527, 0.594] | 0.476 |
| L3 score | 0.756 | [0.701, 0.809] | 0.657 |
| Fused (fitted on H, no leak) | 0.759 | [0.695, 0.825] | 0.740 |
| Fused (all H) | 0.827 | [0.778, 0.874] | 0.771 |
| Fused (cross-fit L) | 0.864 | [0.824, 0.902] | 0.789 |
| Decomposed judge (LLM reads formula) | 0.716 | [0.645, 0.789] | 0.717 |
| L3 with local Qwen2.5-1.5B | 0.708 | [0.637, 0.774] | 0.603 |

The primary no-leak fused score is 0.759. The fused-all-H and cross-fit-L numbers (0.827, 0.864) are shown for completeness but are not valid held-out estimates: the former uses the full track H for fitting, and the latter is a within-L cross-fit that overstates generalisation.

**Track H (human gold errors, n = 258, 57 errors).** Fused out-of-fold AUROC is 0.777 [0.698, 0.847]. L1 alone reaches 0.655, compared to 0.508 on track L. The lint rules fire on human annotation errors but not on LLM outputs, because the two populations produce different formula smells.

#### L1 lint: a negative result on LLM outputs

L1 flags formulas with deterministic smells (existential implication, free variables, arity clashes, vacuity, trivial formulas, dangling predicates). On track L, the true positive rate is 2.0% at a false positive rate of 0.4%, giving AUROC 0.508. This is a negative result: L1 lint does not transfer from human annotation errors (where it is effective, AUROC 0.655) to LLM outputs. The reason is that LLM-generated formulas rarely contain the syntactic pathologies L1 detects; their errors are semantic (wrong predicates, missing conditions, scope mistakes).

All nine individual smell rules have false-alarm rates below 3% on every system:

| Smell | gpt-3.5 FA | gpt-4 FA | davinci-003 FA |
|-|-|-|-|
| EX_IMP | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 || ALL_AND | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| IFF_RESTR | 0.0 | 0.009 | 0.0 |
| GLUE | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| FREE | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| VACUOUS | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| TRIVIAL | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| ARITY | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| DANGLING | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

Only the FREE smell fires on any track-L errors (4 items).

#### L2 role-aware check: below bag-of-words

The role-aware UD-based check (L2-role) achieves AUROC 0.557, which is 0.18 below the simpler bag-of-words check (L2-bow, 0.737). The role-aware layer adds no discriminative power over word overlap.

#### Decomposed judge ablation

Replacing z3 with an LLM that reads the formula directly (the decomposed judge) drops L3 AUROC from 0.756 to 0.697 (ΔAUROC = −0.059). The LLM gets only 57.6% of binary argument slots correct on track L and 36.4% on track H. The z3 answerer is significantly more accurate for structured formula reading.

#### Per-type sensitivity (track L, at binary threshold)

| Error type | n | L1 | L2-bow | L2-role | L3 | Fused | Cascade |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| NEG | 5 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 1.0 |
| QUANT | 2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| CONN | 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| DROP | 142 | 0.028 | 0.479 | 0.127 | 0.197 | 0.599 | 0.606 |
| ADD | 150 | 0.020 | 0.473 | 0.107 | 0.173 | 0.653 | 0.573 |
| SWAP | 12 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.083 | 0.25 | 0.083 | 0.333 |
| BIND | 8 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.375 | 0.25 |
| COMPOUND | 187 | 0.118 | 0.428 | 0.166 | 0.160 | 0.599 | 0.578 |

FOL-Triage is most sensitive to ADD and DROP errors (the largest categories), with the fused score catching about 60%. It misses CONN errors entirely (0/4) and detects SWAP poorly (1/12). Negation errors are fully caught by the cascade (which fires L2-role, where monotonicity shifts are visible) but L1 and L2-bow miss them.

On track H (57 errors), the per-type pattern differs. UNGLUE errors (n = 5) are caught at 100% by L1 and the fused score, because they produce detectable formula smells.

#### Per-type sensitivity (track H)

| Error type | n | L1 | L2-bow | L2-role | L3 | Fused | Cascade |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| NEG | 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.25 |
| REV | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| QUANT | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| RESTR | 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| CONN | 8 | 0.25 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.375 | 0.375 | 0.375 |
| MOVE | 2 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| DROP | 14 | 0.143 | 0.357 | 0.0 | 0.143 | 0.357 | 0.5 |
| ADD | 19 | 0.158 | 0.368 | 0.053 | 0.211 | 0.526 | 0.579 |
| SWAP | 2 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| BIND | 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| UNGLUE | 5 | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| COMPOUND | 33 | 0.303 | 0.182 | 0.242 | 0.182 | 0.545 | 0.636 |

#### Invariance under meaning-preserving rewrites

Five rewrite families were tested on 150 track-L CORRECT items. The table shows the false-alarm rate on the rewritten formula and the flip rate (fraction of items whose binary verdict changes):

| Rewrite | n applies | L1 FA | L1 flip | bow FA | bow flip | role FA | role flip | L3 FA | L3 flip | Fused FA | Fused flip |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| RENAME | 150 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.18 | 0.093 | 0.013 | 0.0 | 0.033 | 0.007 | 0.22 | 0.013 |
| REORDER | 34 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.029 | 0.0 | 0.059 | 0.0 | 0.059 | 0.0 | 0.235 | 0.0 |
| DEMORGAN | 33 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.030 | 0.0 | 0.061 | 0.0 | 0.030 | 0.030 | 0.182 | 0.061 |
| CONTRAPOSITIVE | 40 | 0.025 | 0.025 | 0.10 | 0.0 | 0.025 | 0.025 | 0.025 | 0.0 | 0.275 | 0.0 |
| PRENEX | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

The rewrite false-alarm gate (≤ 10% per family) fails. The worst-family fused FA is 0.275 (CONTRAPOSITIVE), but this equals the FA on the original formulas; the flip rate is at most 0.061. The high FA is not caused by the rewrites but by the fused score's calibration: it was fitted on track H where the CORRECT base rate is higher, producing a systematic over-flagging on track L (FA on track-L CORRECT items is 0.194 versus the 0.10 calibration target).

L1, L2-role, and L3 individually pass the 10% gate. L2-bow fails only under RENAME (FA = 0.18), because renaming predicates breaks the bag-of-words match between text and formula.

[FIGURE:fig_rewrite_fa]

#### Coverage

| Track | n | Parseable | Full coverage rate |
|-|-|-|-|
| L | 753 | 693 | 0.920 |
| H | 302 | 279 | 0.924 |

Parse rates by system: gpt-3.5-turbo 0.889, gpt-4 0.946, text-davinci-003 0.921. Unparseable outputs are scored as p = 1 (maximum error probability) by the fused metric, so all items receive a score. The coverage gate (≥ 90%) passes.

#### Cost

L1 and L2 are free (CPU-only). L3 costs $0.175 per 1,000 calls with Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite. The total per-item cost is $0.0002, passing the $0.002 gate. CPU time (L1 + L2 + z3): median 35 ms, P95 90 ms. L3 latency: median 630 ms, P95 1.68 s.

#### Contamination check

L3 was run on nonce-disguised sentences (content words replaced by nonsense words) on the full track L. AUROC with exact text-formula alignment: 0.765; with disguised text: 0.770. Paired difference: −0.005 [−0.063, 0.049]. There is no evidence that the LLM benefits from having seen the public benchmark sentences.

#### Complexity strata (track L, fused score)

| Stratum | n (error/correct) | Testable | Fused AUROC | L2-bow AUROC | L3 AUROC |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| words < 12 | 443 (179/264) | Yes | 0.781 | 0.742 | 0.772 |
| words 12-19 | 31 (18/13) | No | 0.521 | 0.596 | 0.541 |
| words ≥ 20 | 3 (2/1) | No | 0.500 | 1.000 | 0.000 |
| 0 quantifiers | 302 (130/172) | Yes | 0.743 | 0.728 | 0.771 |
| 1 quantifier | 164 (65/99) | Yes | 0.794 | 0.748 | 0.721 |
| ≥ 2 quantifiers | 11 (4/7) | No | 0.750 | 0.768 | 0.607 |
| depth ≤ 1 | 296 (124/172) | Yes | 0.762 | 0.745 | 0.779 |
| depth 2-3 | 173 (73/100) | Yes | 0.756 | 0.717 | 0.710 |
| depth ≥ 4 | 8 (2/6) | No | 0.667 | 0.750 | 0.500 |
| 0 conditions | 344 (145/199) | Yes | 0.775 | 0.759 | 0.791 |
| 1-2 conditions | 131 (54/77) | Yes | 0.716 | 0.677 | 0.628 |

The frozen screen is dominated by short, simple sentences (93% under 12 words). The long and complex strata (12+ words, 2+ quantifiers, 3+ conditions) have too few items to test. This limitation motivates the held-out dataset (Artifact E), which oversamples these strata.

#### Per-system AUROC (descriptive, n = 3 systems)

| System | n | Error rate | Fused AUROC | L1 AUROC | L2-bow AUROC | L3 AUROC |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | 143 | 0.378 | 0.689 | 0.500 | 0.650 | 0.722 |
| gpt-4 | 177 | 0.367 | 0.700 | 0.496 | 0.716 | 0.720 |
| text-davinci-003 | 157 | 0.510 | 0.857 | 0.525 | 0.811 | 0.817 |

FOL-Triage is most discriminative on text-davinci-003, the weakest system. The Kendall τ between system error rates and mean fused scores is 0.333 (3 systems, descriptive only).

#### Label quality observations

The track-L label distribution reveals a systematic issue: 58.8% of typed ERROR items have only ADD+DROP repair operators. On inspection, most of these are vocabulary or arity choices (e.g. Lunch(james) vs HasLunch(james, company)) that the vocabulary aligner cannot bridge. These are likely CORRECT under a looser equivalence definition. The track-H original gold has 27.1% error rate (errors, uncertain, and reading-choice items) and 5.8% unparseable rate. Among non-equivalent parseable items, 21.9% are correct-but-not-equivalent (VOCAB or GRAN class).

### 1.3 Experiment C: Cross-System Consensus

[ARTIFACT:art_i3cVDxBp-USk]

The consensus metric collects translations of the same sentence from multiple independent LLM families, checks pairwise z3 equivalence, and scores each candidate by its disagreement with the pool. Total API spend was $1.52.

#### Headline AUROCs (track L, ERROR vs CORRECT, n = 546, 249 errors)

| Metric | AUROC | 95% CI | AUPRC |
|-|-|-|-|
| c_score (1 − eq_frac, all peers) | 0.866 | [0.821, 0.906] | 0.827 |
| c_score (6 fresh peers only) | 0.872 | [0.830, 0.911] | 0.825 |
| c_score (non-OpenAI peers) | 0.863 | [0.820, 0.903] | 0.808 |
| c_score (2 Logic-LM peers only) | 0.753 | [0.701, 0.806] | 0.659 |
| medoid depth | 0.722 | [0.673, 0.774] | 0.622 |
| cluster entropy | 0.773 | [0.724, 0.820] | 0.691 |
| SC-5 cheap (gpt-4.1-nano) | 0.725 | [0.669, 0.781] | 0.627 |
| SC-5 same model | 0.716 | [0.632, 0.796] | 0.628 |
| SC-5 entropy | 0.631 | [0.568, 0.693] | 0.539 |
| Prediction set instability (SC) | 0.688 | [0.626, 0.750] | 0.602 |
| Prediction set instability (pool) | 0.770 | [0.717, 0.821] | 0.721 |
| FOL length | 0.527 | [0.470, 0.586] | 0.485 |
| Misalignment (vocab) | 0.835 | [0.794, 0.876] | 0.821 |

[FIGURE:fig_consensus_auroc]

The c_score achieves the highest AUROC in the iteration at 0.866. It beats SC-5 (the self-consistency baseline) by ΔAUROC = +0.140 [0.085, 0.197]. Cross-family consensus also exceeds sampling self-consistency in the related SAC3 framework [17], which uses semantic-aware cross-check consistency for hallucination detection in black-box LLMs. Using only the six fresh peer translations (not the three Logic-LM systems) gives 0.872, slightly higher than using all peers. Restricting to the two other Logic-LM systems drops the AUROC to 0.753, showing that diversity across model families is essential.


The misalignment score (0.835) is high because CORRECT items are by construction alignable to the gold in the labeller, so misalignment alone is a strong proxy for error. This does not generalise to settings without a shared vocabulary.

#### RENAME rewrite invariance: failure

Under predicate renaming (replacing predicate names with WordNet synonyms or nonce names), the c_score false-alarm rate is 96% (100% for constant-only renaming). This is expected and fundamental: two formulas with different predicate names are not z3-equivalent, so any rename breaks the equivalence check. The consensus metric is invariant to rewrites that preserve z3 equivalence (reordering, De Morgan, contrapositive) but not to vocabulary changes.

#### Blind-spot analysis

38% of ERROR items are z3-equivalent to the medoid (the most popular peer formula). This places a ceiling on recall of approximately 62%. The blind-spot rate is 5% for polarity errors and 57% for structural errors.

#### Cost

The peer pool costs $0.0015 per sentence (6 peers via API). Total experiment spend: $1.52. z3 pairwise equivalence checking is free.

### 1.4 Experiment D: Disguised Judge and Baselines

[ARTIFACT:art_elDZY26Pu6GD]

This experiment establishes the bar: every baseline metric and every judge variant on the same shared screen, scored with nonce-disguised sentences to control for memorisation. Total API spend was $2.02 (after the OpenRouter key was restored at 15:11 UTC; local judges ran during the outage and are kept as secondary rows).

#### The bar: disguised cheap judge

The primary cheap judge (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, JSON 0-100 scoring, nonce-disguised sentences) achieves AUROC 0.777 [0.720, 0.827] on track L (n = 524, 230 errors, 294 correct).

#### Full baseline table (track L, ERROR vs CORRECT, n = 524)

[FIGURE:fig_baseline_auroc]

#### Pilot structural metrics: negative result
The user's pilot structural metrics are null on this screen. Joint conflict achieves AUROC 0.513, arity inconsistency 0.500, shape inconsistency 0.524, dangling predicates 0.533, and undeclared predicates 0.525. The cross-system predicate-set Jaccard (pilot_rerun_jacc) reaches 0.720, the only pilot metric with signal, but this is a proxy for the consensus approach tested in Experiment C.

#### Round-trip verification

Round-trip NLI (verbalise the formula, compare to the original sentence via bidirectional NLI entailment) achieves AUROC 0.710 [0.648, 0.769]. This is 0.067 below the cheap judge (p = 0.008 by DeLong test). The round-trip reformalisation check (verbalise, re-translate to FOL, check z3 equivalence with the original) achieves only 0.513, because 76% of items tie at the same score.

Round-trip NLI using local verbalisation (the LLM verbalises on the local GPU instead of the API) reaches 0.740 [0.680, 0.796], slightly higher than the API version.

#### Frontier judge

The strong judge (Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview) achieves AUROC 0.802 [0.715, 0.877] on the strong subsample (n = 291). Under disguise it drops to 0.730 [0.655, 0.803]. The ΔAUROC over the cheap judge is +0.024 [−0.075, 0.111], not significant.

#### Cross-fitted baseline combinations (track L)

| Combination | AUROC | 95% CI |
|-|-|-|
| S1 (structural) | 0.698 | [0.634, 0.761] |
| S2 (round-trip) | 0.687 | [0.625, 0.749] |
| S3 (judges disguised) | 0.771 | [0.705, 0.831] |
| S4 (all cheap features) | 0.817 | [0.762, 0.867] |
| S6 (S4 + local judges) | 0.810 | [0.753, 0.861] |

S4 (all cheap features combined via cross-fitted logistic regression) achieves 0.817. This is +0.039 [−0.010, 0.087] over the cheap judge alone, not significant, but it sets the empirical ceiling for cheap baselines.

#### Contamination analysis

No evidence of contamination was found for any judge. The difference-in-differences (DiD) test compares the disguise effect on track H (where the LLM could have memorised public gold) to track L (where it evaluates its own outputs, not memorisable). All DiD CIs include zero:

| Judge | DiD (H − L) | 95% CI |
|-|-|-|
| flash-lite | −0.042 | [−0.170, 0.094] |
| gpt-4.1-nano | −0.077 | [−0.188, 0.023] |
| gemini-3.1-pro | +0.002 | [−0.115, 0.104] |
| Qwen3-8B | −0.045 | [−0.161, 0.079] |
| Llama-3.1-8B | +0.023 | [−0.112, 0.157] |
| Qwen3-14B | −0.073 | [−0.195, 0.056] |

The gold-recall probe confirms this: when the primary model translates track-H sentences from scratch, it matches the corrected gold 15.9% of the time but the original (public) gold only 4.4%. Predicate-name Jaccard with the original gold minus Jaccard with the Logic-LM GPT-4 output is −0.068 [−0.171, 0.034]; the model is not reproducing the public gold.

#### Invariance of judges under meaning-preserving rewrites

Judges are highly sensitive to meaning-preserving rewrites. The FA on CONTRAPOSITIVE rewrites is 0.67 for the cheap judge (original), 0.51 for the cheap judge (disguised), and 0.95 for the cheap2 judge. This compares poorly to FOL-Triage's fused flip rate of 0.0 on CONTRAPOSITIVE.

The full invariance table (track L CORRECT items, n = 270):

| Metric | RENAME flip | REORDER flip | DEMORGAN flip | CONTRA flip | ALL flip |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| judge_cheap_orig | 0.27 | 0.12 | 0.23 | 0.64 | 0.29 |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.44 | 0.12 | 0.46 | 0.41 | 0.39 |
| judge_cheap2_orig | 0.49 | 0.12 | 0.46 | 0.95 | 0.49 |
| rt_nli_min | 0.37 | 0.10 | 0.31 | 0.33 | 0.31 |
| rt_embed_cos | 0.57 | 0.07 | 0.44 | 0.38 | 0.44 |
| FOL-Triage fused | 0.013 | 0.0 | 0.061 | 0.0 | 0.013 |

FOL-Triage has the lowest flip rate of any metric tested. Judges and round-trip methods change their verdict on 29-49% of meaning-preserving rewrites.

#### Per-error-type sensitivity of judges (track H, curator view, n = 46 errors)

| Group | n | judge_cheap_orig | judge_cheap_disg | judge_cheap2_orig | rt_nli_min |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1-op errors | 13 | 0.308 | 0.538 | 0.462 | 0.231 |
| 2-op errors | 11 | 0.545 | 0.818 | 0.727 | 0.273 |
| ADD | 12 | 0.500 | 0.750 | 0.667 | 0.250 |
| COMPOUND | 22 | 0.545 | 0.864 | 0.773 | 0.273 |
| DROP | 11 | 0.455 | 0.636 | 0.455 | 0.182 |
| CONN | 3 | 0.667 | 0.667 | 1.000 | 0.333 |
| NEG | 2 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 1.000 | 0.500 |
| SWAP | 2 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.500 | 0.000 |

The disguised judge is more sensitive than the original judge for most error types, suggesting that nonce disguise forces the model to read more carefully.

#### Judge error-type classification accuracy

The judge's ability to name the correct error type is poor. On track-H 1-op errors, it identifies the correct repair operator 0% of the time (0/12). On 2-op errors, it is correct 45% (5/11). On track L, accuracy is 20% for 1-op and 27% for 2-op errors.

#### Complexity analysis (track L)

A logistic regression of judge correctness on standardised word count yields a coefficient of −0.48 (SE 0.11, p < 0.001): the judge is significantly less reliable on longer sentences. On track H (where longer sentences are available), the coefficient is −0.14 (SE 0.17, p = 0.41), consistent in direction but underpowered.

| Stratum | n (err/cor) | judge_cheap_disg AUROC | rt_nli_min AUROC |
|-|-|-|-|
| words < 12 | 485 (210/275) | 0.784 | 0.713 |
| words 12-19 | 36 (18/18) | 0.667 | 0.670 |
| quantifiers 0-1 | 512 (226/286) | 0.784 | 0.712 |
| depth ≤ 3 | 466 (199/267) | 0.781 | 0.702 |
| depth 4-5 | 54 (30/24) | 0.762 | 0.828 |
| 0 conditions | 394 (182/212) | 0.783 | 0.745 |
| 1-2 conditions | 128 (48/80) | 0.765 | 0.653 |

#### System-level descriptive statistics (3 systems, descriptive only)

| System | True error rate | Judge flag rate | rt_nli_min mean | Parse failures |

| text-davinci-003 | 0.527 | 0.553 | 0.663 | 20/266 |

#### API outage and robustness

The shared OpenRouter key was exhausted at 13:29 UTC and restored at 15:11 UTC. During the outage, all LLM judges ran on the local RTX 4000 Ada GPU with the same prompts (Qwen3-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-14B-nf4). After the key was restored, the API judges were run and designated as primary; the local judges are kept as secondary rows. The local Qwen3-8B judge achieves AUROC 0.757 (disguised), comparable to the API flash-lite judge at 0.777.

### 1.5 Iteration 1 Summary

The four candidates and the bar:

| Method | AUROC | 95% CI | n | Cost/item | Rewrite flip rate |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| c_score (consensus) | 0.866 | [0.821, 0.906] | 546 | $0.0015/sent | 96% (RENAME) |

| **Bar: judge_cheap_disg** | **0.777** | **[0.720, 0.827]** | **524** | **$0.00004** | **0.39** |
| FOL-Triage fused | 0.759 | [0.695, 0.825] | 477 | $0.0002 | 0.013 |
| rt_nli_min | 0.710 | [0.648, 0.769] | 524 | $0.00001 | 0.31 |
| L1 lint | 0.508 | [0.499, 0.519] | 477 | $0 | 0.0 |
| Pilot structural | 0.50-0.53 | n/a | 524 | $0 | n/a |

[FIGURE:fig_summary_comparison]

**What iteration 1 established:**

1. The cross-system consensus metric (c_score = 1 − eq_frac) achieves the highest AUROC at 0.866, beating SC-5 by +0.140. It requires peer translations from multiple model families and is fundamentally non-invariant to predicate renaming (96% FA under RENAME).

2. The disguised cheap judge sets the bar at AUROC 0.777. The S4 combination of all cheap features reaches 0.817 (+0.039, not significant). The frontier judge (Gemini 3.1 Pro) adds nothing significant over the cheap judge.

3. FOL-Triage achieves AUROC 0.759, below the bar. Its primary value is invariance: the fused flip rate under meaning-preserving rewrites is 0.013, compared to 0.29-0.49 for judges. However, the fused false-alarm rate on CORRECT items is 0.194, exceeding the 0.10 calibration target.

4. L1 lint does not transfer from human annotation errors to LLM outputs. The pilot structural metrics are null. Round-trip NLI is 0.067 below the judge.

5. The evaluation labels are noisy: 58.8% of track-L "errors" are pure ADD+DROP (likely vocabulary mismatches). Iteration 2 will re-evaluate under panel-adjudicated labels from the held-out set.

6. No contamination was detected for any LLM-based metric.

**What remains for iteration 2:** (a) Re-evaluate all candidates under adjudicated labels from Artifact E. (b) Compute the paired ΔAUROC between FOL-Triage and the disguised judge on shared items. (c) Test whether combining the consensus metric with FOL-Triage or the judge produces a significant improvement. (d) Confirm on the held-out set.

## Iteration 2

### 2.1 Strategy

Iteration 2 has three goals: (i) confirm iteration 1's ordering on the held-out dataset E under both the solver labels (R_AB, R_A) and panel-adjudicated labels (R_ADJ); (ii) test whether fusing the consensus signal (PEER) with text-based checks (TEXT = L2-bow + L3) improves over each alone; and (iii) construct a typed perturbation suite (PERTURB) for controlled sensitivity testing.

The pre-registered bar for this iteration is the flash-lite judge on disguised sentences, with the local Qwen3-8B judge as fallback if the API is unavailable. The shared OpenRouter key hit its daily limit at 18:00 UTC on 2026-09-23, before the held-out experiment completed, and did not recover before the run deadline. The flash-lite bar is therefore UNTESTABLE on E; the fallback local judge (Qwen3-8B, rubric B, greedy; screen AUROC 0.757 vs 0.777 for flash-lite) is the labelled secondary bar for all rows reported below.

### 2.2 Experiment 5: PEER+TEXT on held-out dataset E

[ARTIFACT:art_TaxJRnPcJMuZ]

PEER+TEXT is a logistic fusion of the consensus signal (c_score with shared-vocabulary alignment, denoted c_score_align) and the text-based FOL-Triage layers (L2-bow, L3 questionnaire). The fusion weights were fitted on the iteration-1 screen and frozen before any E score was computed (prereg sha256 b9f28b1bf6bf). API spend was $0 (all components ran on CPU and the local GPU; no OpenRouter calls completed).

#### Name-free alignment: failed the pre-registered screen gate

A name-free variant of the consensus metric (graded clause consensus, g_score) was pre-registered as the primary PEER signal. It matches formula clauses by structural role without relying on shared predicate names, using anchored-cost assignment and Murty k-best matching. Under the pre-registered selection rule, both name-free variants (NF-pure and NF-anchored) failed the screen gate: for both, more than 10% of AGREE track-L CORRECT items tie at g = 1, making the deterministic false-alarm threshold degenerate (ROLE_PERMUTE recall = 0).

A post-hoc analysis with fractional tie-breaking showed this failure was a threshold-tie artefact. NF-anchored passes both gates under fractional scoring (RENAME FA 0.074, ROLE_PERMUTE recall 0.771); NF-pure still fails ROLE_PERMUTE (recall 0.186). The NF-anchored fusion was fitted post-hoc and applied to E as a labelled sensitivity analysis. On E (R_AB pooled), the NF-anchored fusion achieves AUROC 0.759 [0.72, 0.79], which is 0.031 below the pre-registered PEER+TEXT fusion (0.790), with the CI excluding zero [−0.042, −0.020]. The shared-aligner confound with the solver labeller remains open.

#### Headline AUROCs on E (R_AB, ERROR vs CORRECT)

| Subset | n (err/cor) | PEER+TEXT | c_score_align | NF c_score | L2-bow | L3 | Local judge |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| R_AB pooled | 2686 (1822/864) | 0.790 [0.75, 0.82] | 0.782 [0.74, 0.82] | 0.743 [0.70, 0.78] | 0.734 [0.71, 0.76] | 0.579 [0.53, 0.62] | 0.712 |
| R_AB L25 | 873 (697/176) | 0.755 [0.70, 0.80] | 0.712 [0.65, 0.77] | 0.651 [0.59, 0.71] | 0.722 [0.67, 0.77] | 0.560 [0.49, 0.63] | 0.664 |
| R_AB L20 | 821 (592/229) | 0.747 [0.69, 0.80] | 0.722 [0.66, 0.78] | 0.643 [0.58, 0.70] | 0.715 [0.66, 0.76] | 0.547 [0.48, 0.62] | 0.683 |
| R_AB EXC | 606 (384/222) | 0.777 [0.72, 0.83] | 0.814 [0.76, 0.86] | 0.782 [0.72, 0.84] | 0.669 [0.61, 0.72] | 0.620 [0.55, 0.69] | 0.663 |
| R_AB CTRL | 386 (149/237) | 0.708 [0.57, 0.84] | 0.742 [0.62, 0.86] | 0.741 [0.61, 0.86] | 0.613 [0.54, 0.72] | 0.490 [0.37, 0.62] | 0.739 |
| R_AB long pool | 2300 (1673/627) | 0.768 [0.74, 0.80] | 0.759 [0.72, 0.79] | 0.704 [0.67, 0.74] | 0.717 [0.69, 0.75] | 0.580 [0.54, 0.62] | 0.653 |

[FIGURE:fig_held_out_auroc]

#### PEER+TEXT vs the local judge

The paired ΔAUROC of PEER+TEXT minus the local judge is +0.078 [0.043, 0.112] on R_AB pooled (DeLong p < 0.0001). On the long pool (L25+L20+EXC), the gap widens to +0.115 [0.075, 0.157]. On R_A (tier-A adjudicated labels, L20+EXC), the gap is +0.264 [0.157, 0.359].

The flash-lite judge comparison is untestable: only 20 items received flash-lite scores before the key was exhausted, yielding a ΔAUROC of +0.057 [−0.200, 0.360] (n = 20, uninformative).

#### Does fusion beat c_score_align alone?

The stratified AUROC (pairing only within complexity strata, removing the composition confound) shows PEER+TEXT at 0.753 and c_score_align at 0.741, a difference of +0.011 [−0.012, 0.038], not significant. On the long pool the stratified gap is +0.016 [−0.010, 0.041]. On R_A the gap is −0.036 [−0.113, 0.030], favouring c_score_align. The TEXT layers add no significant discriminative power over c_score_align alone once the stratum-composition confound is removed.

#### Mechanism predictions

Four pre-registered mechanism predictions were tested on E:

**P1 (PEER catches COVERAGE errors that TEXT misses, and vice versa).** At matched false-alarm rate 0.10 with fractional tie-breaking: PEER has higher recall than TEXT on COVERAGE errors (+0.093 [0.046, 0.147]), and TEXT has higher recall on PEER_ENDORSED errors (+0.103 [0.051, 0.171]). The crossover exists, but the fused PEER+TEXT recall is not higher than c_score_align alone on any group except COVERAGE. Verdict: INCONCLUSIVE.

**P2 (PEER and TEXT error rankings are uncorrelated).** Spearman correlation between PEER and TEXT among errors is 0.294 [0.224, 0.365]. This is moderate, not near zero. The gain from fusion over the best single signal (PEER) is only +0.042 AUROC, and the share from PEER-endorsed errors is −0.200, meaning TEXT hurts on items PEER already handles. Verdict: REFUTED.

**P3 (PEER+TEXT advantage grows with sentence complexity).** The logistic interaction term z(score)·z(words) is −0.023 [−0.228, 0.185] for PEER+TEXT, consistent with no interaction. The diff-in-Δ (long minus CTRL) of PEER+TEXT minus the local judge is +0.146 [0.020, 0.269], but this reflects the judge degrading on long sentences, not the fusion improving. Verdict: INCONCLUSIVE.

**P4 (PEER+TEXT is more invariant to meaning-preserving rewrites than judges).** On the screen pools, the fused score's RENAME false-alarm rate is 0.385 and the local judge's is 0.683. The fused score is better than judges but far worse than FOL-Triage's 0.013. The c_score_align component drives most of the fused FA under RENAME (0.859). Verdict: REFUTED.

#### Rewrite false alarms (screen, CORRECT bases)

| Rewrite | n | Fused | c_score_align | NF g | L2-bow | L3 | Local judge |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| RENAME | 104 | 0.385 | 0.859 | 0.074 | 0.216 | 0.168 | 0.683 |
| REORDER | 27 | 0.222 | 0.178 | 0.037 | 0.044 | 0.444 | 0.000 |
| DEMORGAN | 26 | 0.154 | 0.185 | 0.038 | 0.046 | 0.231 | 0.231 |
| CONTRAPOSITIVE | 28 | 0.107 | 0.063 | 0.237 | 0.075 | 0.188 | 0.214 |

The NF g_score has the lowest RENAME false-alarm rate (0.074) of any consensus-based signal, confirming the value of name-free matching. However, its CONTRAPOSITIVE FA (0.237) is higher than c_score_align's (0.063).

#### Error typing

On R_A errors with 1-2 typed repair operators (n = 453), the top-code accuracy of the medoid-ops typed repair is 0.371 (codable-only 0.561, n = 262). Chance level is 0.382. The local judge's type-classification accuracy is 0.022 (10/453). Error typing from automated metrics remains unreliable.

#### System-level correlation

Kendall τ-b of each metric vs the R_AB system error rate across 13 system × variant rows: PEER+TEXT 0.718, TEXT alone 0.769, PEER alone 0.692, local judge 0.667. All metrics track system quality at the aggregate level.

#### Contamination on E

The local Qwen3-8B judge shows a disguise effect in the unexpected direction: disguised AUROC (0.712) exceeds original AUROC (0.648) by +0.064 [0.032, 0.098]. This is likely because nonce disguise forces the model to attend to structural cues rather than relying on surface familiarity. The DiD test (comparing the disguise effect on track H vs track L) yields +0.045 [−0.073, 0.161], with the CI including zero. No contamination is detected. The PEER signal has no contamination channel, because it uses z3 equivalence (no text or names from the benchmark enter the scoring).

#### Coverage and cost

Of 8,507 rows, 7,421 (87.2%) are parseable and scored; 1,086 (12.8%) are unparseable (scored as maximum error probability). 38 rows have no peer translations available. The L3 questionnaire completed on all parseable rows. Mean CPU time per row: PEER pairs 0.026 s, NF pairs 0.208 s, TEXT 0.220 s. Mean cost per row for PEER+TEXT (L3 share): $0.000018. The local judge costs $0.000040 per row.

### 2.3 Evaluation 1: Re-evaluation under alternative label regimes

[ARTIFACT:art_HepAw8c6Eu7-]

The iteration-1 experiments used solver labels (R_SOLVER): a formula is CORRECT if z3 proves it equivalent to the audited gold, ERROR otherwise. This is conservative: formulas that are semantically faithful but use different vocabulary or granularity are counted as errors. The parallel run adjudicated a panel of labels (R_ADJ) on the same items, where three LLM judges vote on faithfulness given only the sentence and candidate. This evaluation re-scores all metrics under 13 label regimes on a common item set (588 items shared across experiments A, C, D, and E).

#### Rederivation audit

All 57 reviewer-audited quantities from the iteration-1 report reproduce exactly under independent recomputation (57/57 MATCH, tolerance ≤ 0.01 for AUROCs, ≤ 0.005 for bootstrap replicas). The reviewer's own RNG seed replicas match to ≤ 0.0005.

#### Regime AUROC matrix (common set, selected metrics)

| Metric | R_SOLVER | R_ADJ_AB | R_ADJ_A | R_ADJ_ALL |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| PT (PEER+TEXT) | 0.871 | 0.877 | 0.932 | 0.906 |
| fused_H (FOL-Triage) | 0.770 | 0.868 | 0.958 | 0.866 |
| c_score | 0.849 | 0.779 | 0.786 | 0.831 |
| L2-bow | 0.732 | 0.815 | 0.917 | 0.810 |
| L3 | 0.761 | 0.718 | 0.813 | 0.751 |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.782 | 0.772 | 0.751 | 0.816 |
| judge_cheap_orig | 0.754 | 0.797 | 0.858 | 0.785 |
| sc5_cheap | 0.713 | 0.703 | 0.676 | 0.737 |
| rt_nli_min | 0.709 | 0.749 | 0.731 | 0.760 |

Under R_ADJ_AB, PEER+TEXT (0.877) leads, followed by FOL-Triage fused (0.868) and L2-bow (0.815). The c_score drops from 0.849 (solver) to 0.779 (R_ADJ_AB), because the adjudicated labels reclassify many vocabulary-mismatch items as CORRECT, removing the easy wins for the consensus signal. Under R_ADJ_A (tier-A only, 75 common items), FOL-Triage reaches 0.958 and PEER+TEXT 0.932, both well above the judges.

#### Label regime shifts

On the 161 items shared between R_SOLVER and R_ADJ_AB (36 label changes), the label-only shift is:

| Metric | Shift | 95% CI | Direction |
|-|-|-|-|
| fused_H | +0.080 | [0.003, 0.171] | UP |
| L2-bow | +0.102 | [0.018, 0.192] | UP |
| c_score | −0.106 | [−0.255, 0.013] | INSIDE CI |
| judge_cheap_disg | +0.018 | [−0.094, 0.134] | INSIDE CI |

BOW and the fused score benefit from adjudicated labels (their AUROCs go up), because the vocabulary-mismatch items they flag correctly are now labelled CORRECT. The c_score shift is negative but not significant, consistent with its reliance on the same vocabulary alignment that the solver uses.

#### Flipped items

Between solver and adjudicated labels, 51 items flip from CORRECT to ERROR and 1 flips from ERROR to CORRECT. The fused score (FOL-Triage) flags 83% of the CORRECT→ERROR items at matched FA 0.20, while c_score flags only 34%. This indicates that the text-based layers detect errors that the solver misses (vocabulary-equivalent but semantically wrong).

#### Frontier vs cheap judge

On the subset where both frontier (Gemini 3.1 Pro) and cheap judge scores are available, the frontier judge's advantage is large and significant under adjudicated labels. Under R_ADJ_AB: strong_orig vs cheap_orig ΔAUROC = +0.166 (p < 0.001). Under R_ADJ_ALL: +0.159. This reverses the iteration-1 finding (which showed no significant advantage under solver labels), confirming that the solver labels masked the frontier judge's advantage on vocabulary-mismatch items.

#### Contamination on the common set

All DiD CIs include zero across all judges. The MDE (minimum detectable effect at 80% power) ranges from 0.12 to 0.21, so small contamination effects cannot be ruled out but no evidence was found. The gpt-4.1-nano judge shows significant single-track drops on H (AUROC disg−orig = −0.114 [−0.206, −0.028]), but the DiD with track L is +0.077 [−0.028, 0.190], not significant.

### 2.4 Dataset 3: R_COMP and PERTURB

[ARTIFACT:art_zcwCQgTqk6DN]

This artifact constructs two evaluation resources: R_COMP (long composed sentences with trusted FOL references) and PERTURB (a typed perturbation suite with z3-verified controls).

#### R_COMP: incomplete (OpenRouter key exhausted)

The R_COMP component generates long, complex sentences (≥ 25 words, ≥ 3 conditions) by composing atoms from a verified lexicon of 652 entries extracted from FOLIO and MALLS source formulas. Nine templates (T1-T9) produce sentences with weak and strong exception readings, each with a z3-verified reference formula. The composition pipeline selected 250 main + 100 reserve sentences from 5,109 filtered candidates.

The candidate generation, labelling, and adjudication phases did not run because the shared OpenRouter key hit its $50 daily limit at approximately 18:00 UTC, after $0.41 in lexicon-extraction calls. The key did not recover before the module's deadline. The replacement key arrived at 21:38 UTC but was already at its daily limit. R_COMP references are constructed deterministically and are correct by construction, but the LLM-generated candidate translations and their labels are absent.

#### PERTURB: complete

The typed perturbation suite applies 12 operator types to 300 base formulas (200 from dataset E, 100 from R_COMP sentences) to produce controlled mutants where the error type and direction are known by construction. All mutants are z3-verified: the DOWN mutant is z3-non-equivalent to the base and the matched CONTROL is z3-equivalent.

| Statistic | Value |
|-|-|
| Base formulas | 300 |
| Total mutants (DOWN + UP) | 4,234 |
| Matched controls | 868 |
| Total suite rows | 5,102 |
| Complete DOWN/UP pairs | 1,354 |
| z3 verification failures | 0 |
| Operator types | 12 (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE) |
| Cost | $0.41 |

Each perturbation row carries a known label (ERROR for DOWN mutants, CORRECT for controls) and a typed operator, enabling per-type sensitivity analysis without relying on automated error classification. The suite is fully deterministic and re-runnable.

### 2.5 Iteration 2 Summary

**What iteration 2 established:**

1. PEER+TEXT achieves AUROC 0.790 [0.75, 0.82] on the held-out dataset E (R_AB pooled, n = 2686), beating the local judge by +0.078 [0.043, 0.112] (DeLong p < 0.0001). On long sentences (L25+L20+EXC, n = 2300) the gap widens to +0.115 [0.075, 0.157]. The flash-lite judge bar is UNTESTABLE due to API key exhaustion (only 20 rows scored).

2. Fusion does not significantly beat c_score_align alone. The stratified AUROC difference (PEER+TEXT minus c_score_align) is +0.011 [−0.012, 0.038] on R_AB pooled. The TEXT layers add coverage on COVERAGE-type errors (+0.093 recall at matched FA) but hurt on PEER-endorsed errors (−0.200 share). The mechanism prediction P2 (uncorrelated error rankings) is REFUTED: Spearman(PEER, TEXT) = 0.294.

3. The name-free consensus variant (NF-anchored) failed the pre-registered screen gate due to a threshold-tie artefact. Post-hoc fractional scoring shows it passes both gates (RENAME FA 0.074, ROLE_PERMUTE recall 0.771) and achieves AUROC 0.759 on E, 0.031 below PEER+TEXT. The NF approach has the lowest RENAME false-alarm rate (0.074) of any consensus signal, confirming the value of vocabulary-independent matching, but was not used in the primary analysis.

4. Under adjudicated labels (R_ADJ_AB), the metric ranking changes. FOL-Triage fused rises from 0.770 (solver) to 0.868 (adjudicated). The c_score drops from 0.849 to 0.779. This is because adjudicated labels reclassify vocabulary-mismatch items as CORRECT, removing the consensus signal's easy wins. PEER+TEXT (0.877) still leads under adjudicated labels.

5. The frontier judge advantage is large under adjudicated labels (+0.166 AUROC over the cheap judge under R_ADJ_AB, p < 0.001), reversing the non-significant iteration-1 finding under solver labels. Solver labels masked the frontier judge's advantage.

6. All 57 reviewer-audited numbers from iteration 1 reproduce exactly (57/57 MATCH).

7. The PERTURB suite (4,234 typed mutants + 868 controls, 12 operator types, all z3-verified) is complete and ready for per-type sensitivity analysis. R_COMP candidate generation is blocked on the OpenRouter key.

**What remains:**

(a) Run the flash-lite judge on E when the OpenRouter key resets, to test the pre-registered bar. (b) Complete R_COMP candidate generation and labelling. (c) Score all metrics on the PERTURB suite for per-type sensitivity under known labels. (d) Re-fit the PEER+TEXT fusion under R_ADJ labels (the current fusion was fitted under solver labels, which penalise it). (e) Test whether a name-free fusion (NF-anchored + TEXT) closes the 0.031 gap with the aligner-based fusion when the aligner confound is removed.

## Related Work

**NL-FOL datasets and their quality.** FOLIO [1] provides 1,435 FOL-annotated NLI problems. MALLS [2] uses GPT-4 to generate and verify NL-FOL pairs at scale. Brunello et al. [4] found that approximately 42% of entries in both datasets contain incorrect FOL formalisations, with additional ambiguity rates of 17.8% (FOLIO) and 51% (MALLS). Their LLM-assisted re-labelling framework reduces human effort by 5-15× compared to exhaustive review. Logic-LM [10] prompts LLMs for FOL and calls a prover, releasing outputs that we use as our evaluation screen.

**FOL closeness metrics.** Thatikonda et al. [5] evaluate n-gram, graph, embedding, and LLM-based metrics on controlled FOL perturbations, finding that no single metric is sensitive to all perturbation types. Smatch++ is the most sensitive to quantifier changes, while BL-score responds most to negation. Their work measures sensitivity to synthetic perturbations; ours measures faithfulness prediction on real LLM outputs with noisy labels.

**NL-FOL error taxonomies.** Thatikonda et al. [6] propose a verification pipeline with a 28-category error taxonomy. Brunello et al. [4] classify errors into semantic and structural categories. Our typed repair operators (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE) follow the same tradition but are derived from z3 equivalence-class differences rather than manual annotation.

**Factuality metrics.** FRANK [11] defines a typology of factuality errors in abstractive summarisation and evaluates correlation of automatic metrics with human judgments. QuestEval [13] uses question generation and answering to assess factual consistency. QAGS [12] similarly generates questions from a summary and checks whether the source answers them the same way. Our L3 questionnaire layer is closest to this family: it generates structured questions from the text and checks the formula's answers via z3, rather than using another LLM.

**Round-trip and self-consistency.** Amrollahi et al. [7] propose verbalising a formal statement back to natural language and checking consistency, reporting high accuracy on mathematical autoformalization. Li et al. [8] use symbolic equivalence and semantic consistency for Lean/Isabelle autoformalization. Our round-trip baseline follows the same pattern but achieves only AUROC 0.710 on NL-FOL, below the LLM judge.

**Monotonicity and polarity.** SyGNS [14] tests monotonicity reasoning in NLI models. Udep2Mono [15] computes monotonicity profiles from Universal Dependencies. Our L2 role-aware layer attempted to use monotonicity-aware comparisons but achieved AUROC 0.557, a negative result.

**Counter-interpretation methods.** CLOVER [9] generates counter-interpretations to test logical validity via an LLM oracle. Our consensus approach is related in spirit: it uses multiple independent translations as implicit counter-proposals, but relies on z3 equivalence rather than LLM-generated counterexamples.

**Cross-check consistency.** SAC3 [17] detects hallucinations in black-box LLMs by sampling diverse perturbations of a query and checking consistency across answers. Our cross-system consensus metric uses a similar principle: disagreement among independent translations signals error. It operates on FOL equivalence rather than textual similarity, and uses multiple model families rather than perturbations of a single model. The ΔAUROC of cross-family consensus over single-model self-consistency is +0.140 in our setting, consistent with SAC3's finding that semantic-aware cross-checking outperforms naive self-consistency.

**Automated alignment for autoformalization.** FormalAlign [18] trains a model on both autoformalization and alignment scoring via a dual contrastive-generative loss, targeting Lean/Isabelle autoformalization. It is the closest published gold-free alignment scorer for formal languages. Our approach differs in that we use no learned alignment model: the consensus signal relies on z3 equivalence among independent translations, and the text-based signal uses deterministic checks and a prompted questionnaire. FormalAlign targets mathematical theorem proving, where the target language has a type checker; NL-FOL has no such verifier, making gold-free evaluation harder.

**Vacuity detection.** Kupferman and Vardi [16] formalise vacuity in temporal logic model checking. Our L1 lint layer includes a vacuity check (detecting formulas where a subformula can be replaced by its negation without changing the truth value), adapted from their framework.

<reviewer_feedback>
Paper reviewer feedback from the previous iteration. Your strategy MUST address these critiques.
Prioritize major issues — these are the most impactful improvements to make.

The previous review is BLOCKING: the paper must not ship as it stands. Every MUST-FIX item below is a requirement for this iteration, not a suggestion — an iteration that leaves one unaddressed does not publish.

- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Executed artifact gen_art_experiment_6 (iteration-2 baseline arm plus Candidate B2) is missing from the report. It ran every baseline the user asked for on dataset E with identical rows, folds and labels, all locally because of F-KEY. Results (results/summary.md, analysis_E.json):
- S4_local 0.748 [0.709, 0.782], +0.038 [0.005, 0.069] over the local judge; R_A +0.076; long pool +0.059.
- S4 without an LLM judge 0.703, which ties the judge.
- SC-5 0.664; round-trip NLI 0.626; round-trip embedding 0.578.
- The user's pilot metrics 0.50–0.54, null again; pilot_rerun_jacc 0.660.
- parse_fail 0.684 in the COVERAGE view.
- B2 world probe: 0.574 pooled and 0.509 on the long pool. Its reader failed the pre-registered gate (balanced accuracy 0.476 vs ≥0.85), so B2 is NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_FUSION. The dropped-condition UNDETERMINED hypothesis is not supported (AUROC 0.529). A post-hoc thinking-mode reader reaches 0.79 on 124/251 items.
- GEE length slopes: judge −0.56, round-trip −0.70, B2 −0.62, S4 −0.29, SC-5 +0.27 n.s.
- Per-type recall at FA 0.10.
- System τ-b: judge 0.667, B2 −0.026.
- Invariance on exp D's 282 rewrites: B2 has 0 flips except RENAME (0.127).
- Qwen3-14B vs 8B n.s.
- Correct-but-not-equivalent shares: 0.773 L25, 0.721 L20, 0.441 EXC, 0.215 CTRL; MALLS gold judged wrong 0.822.
- Test-retest Spearman 0.989.
This is also where Candidate B finally ran and failed, so the report's silence repeats last round's 'dead end vanished' defect.
  Action: Add a subsection 'Experiment 6: every baseline and B2 on E [ARTIFACT id of gen_art_experiment_6]'. Transcribe summary.md tables 1, 2 (with the GEE table), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 verbatim with their file paths, including the F-KEY deviation list. Record B2 as a labelled DEAD END with its gate evidence (results/b2_gate.json) and the think-mode diagnostic (results/b2_think_diagnostic.json, post hoc). State that B1, the template verbaliser with NLI, was never run in any iteration.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The report never tests or states the verdict on the iteration-2 hypothesis clause 'PEER+TEXT beats S4' (upd_hypo, gen_strat_1). Exp 5 marks criterion (b) as 'iteration-3 join' (deviation D11), and the report copies none of it. The per-item files needed for the test exist. My join (audit/pt_vs_s4.py → audit/pt_vs_s4.json) uses exp 5 per_item_E.jsonl × exp 6 full_method_out.json on R_AB, n=2,672, 1,810 errors, 283 sentences, sentence-cluster bootstrap B=2000:
- PT − S4_local = +0.042 [0.014, 0.070];
- c_score_align − S4_local = +0.035 [0.006, 0.064];
- PT − S4_noLLMjudge = +0.087 [0.053, 0.119];
- nested cross-fit on fold_E, [S4_local, PT] vs refit S4_local = +0.055 [0.036, 0.074].
On the long pool, PT is 0.769 vs S4 0.711.
These are the run's first 'adds signal beyond the baselines' numbers, which is the user's bar ('a new metric matters only if it adds signal those don't'), and they are missing. The caveat: S4 is a LOCAL stack. There is no API judge, API SC or frontier model in it.
  Action: Add a 'Hypothesis verdict' table with one row per clause and a status for each:
- vs local judge on R_AB: supported;
- vs flash-lite: untestable;
- vs S4 (local): supported, with the numbers above;
- R_A: supported;
- R_ADJ: untestable, regime dropped;
- R_COMP: not built;
- fusion > c_score_align: not supported.
Have the report's author re-run the paired PT−S4_local and nested stack from the per-item files (or cite this reviewer's audit/pt_vs_s4.json), and state that the S4 comparison is against local components only.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Executed artifact gen_art_dataset_2 (R_ADJ, the gated Sonnet-5 adjudicator) is missing, and the report reuses its name for something else.
- Its pre-registered gate FAILED: Sonnet-5 balanced accuracy 0.767 (recall faithful 0.825, unfaithful 0.709), 0.662 on track-H expert pairs, judging 15/37 expert-rejected originals FAITHFUL. Grok-4.20 scored 0.634.
- So R_ADJ was DROPPED. Only cell D (601 rows) got ungated dual labels, which are descriptive: both models side with the panel on 239/274 and with the solver on 225/233. Spend was $3.66.
- §2.1 lists 'panel-adjudicated labels (R_ADJ)' as goal (i), and §2.3 attributes 'R_ADJ' labels to 'the parallel run', where 'three LLM judges vote'. Those §2.3 regimes are actually dataset E's own Haiku/GLM/Kimi screen audit (screen_adjudicated_labels.json), whose strictness the dataset card documents: it accepts 0.613 of expert-corrected formulas.
A third label source failing calibration is itself a finding about label reliability, which the user explicitly asked to estimate. Omitting it hides that two frontier adjudicators could not pass a 0.85 gate.
  Action: Add 'Dataset 2: R_ADJ, gate FAILED, dropped' with radj_card.md's gate table, the test-retest (flip 0.07, κ 0.83), the Sonnet-vs-Grok κ (0.50 calibration, 0.42 cell D), the cell-D descriptive cross-tab and spend. Rename §2.3's regimes to R_PANEL_* and correct 'the parallel run' to 'dataset E's own panel screen audit'. State that goal (i)'s R_ADJ half failed.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) Several iteration-2 statements contradict the artifacts they cite.
(a) Contamination on E. The DiD '+0.045 [−0.073, 0.161]' is exactly the iteration-1 SCREEN DiD for judge_local_qwen8b (gen_art_evaluation_1/tables/contamination.csv). Exp 5's analysis.json i_contamination computes no DiD: judge_cheap and disguised L3 are 'untestable', and only orig−disg −0.064 [−0.098, −0.032] (MDE 0.047) exists. Exp 6's real E DiD for Llama is +0.162 [0.064, 0.261], 'consistent with memorisation', and the artifact rates contamination 'not established'. That contradicts 'No contamination is detected'.
(b) 'Nonce disguise forces the model to attend to structural cues'. The evaluation (judge_matched_fa.csv) shows the ORIGINAL cheap judge has higher recall at matched FA 0.10: +0.106 [0.033, 0.178] solver, +0.198 A+B. The explanation is untested.
(c) Fusion fit. screen_fit.json fits the fusion on AGREE items (solver and panel agree), not on solver labels.
(d) Frontier 'reverses iteration-1'. frontier_same_item.csv R_SOLVER_OWN_C gives +0.076 [0.005, 0.152], and exp D itself gave +0.077 [0.006, 0.154]. The 'no significant advantage' premise is the uncorrected +0.024 row.
(e) P1. '+0.103 [0.051, 0.171]' is the PEER_ENDORSED_NF group. On PEER_ENDORSED it is −0.030 [−0.090, 0.021], n.s. The local judge has the highest recall on both endorsed groups (0.169 and 0.199), which goes unmentioned.
(f) P4. It compares fused RENAME FA 0.385 with FOL-Triage's 0.013, but 0.013 is a flip rate. FOL-Triage's fused RENAME FA is 0.22.
(g) Spend. 'API spend was $0 (no OpenRouter calls completed)' conflicts with deviations D1: 699/700 L3 questionnaires and 20 flash-lite calls ran via API; the artifact summary says $0.155.
  Action: Correct each statement in place with the cited file and value:
(a) replace with exp 5 i_contamination plus exp 6 contamination table 4;
(b) delete or mark the explanation 'untested; screen matched-FA evidence runs the other way';
(c) state the AGREE-item fit, features, coefficients and the 0.943→0.790 shrinkage;
(d) replace 'reverses' with 'strengthens (+0.077 solver, p=.015 → +0.166 panel A+B, n=90)';
(e) use the correct group names and add the judge column;
(f) compare FA with FA;
(g) give L3 as an API component and the true spend.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) None of the nine iteration-1 MUST-FIX items from the previous (blocking) review was applied. Diffing the iteration-1 section of this report against the iteration-1 report (iter_1/gen_report_text) shows only table-separator/dash changes and one added SAC3 sentence. Still standing, uncorrected:
- the 'panel agrees with expert-corrected labels on both faithful and unfaithful items' sentence, and the claim that labels come from 'z3 equivalence to audited gold' (tier counts absent);
- 'screen audit confirms the label assignment';
- '58.8% ADD+DROP likely CORRECT', contradicted by the 58/62/55 CORRECT→ERROR vs 1 ERROR→CORRECT transitions the evaluation reproduced;
- the frontier '+0.024, adds nothing significant, n=291';
- Candidate B silently replaced by exp D's LLM-verbaliser round-trip;
- none of the missing exp A/C/D tables (H_primary, H_curator, L_unparseable_as_error with parse_fail 0.598, exp C vocab-clean 0.852, the 9-system Spearman, exp A/C error-typing readouts, etc.);
- no coverage table, no function inventory, no 'Iteration 0' block;
- 'ALL flip 0.013', 'lowest flip rate of any metric', and c_score's 96% FA sitting in the flip column;
- 'reads more carefully' and 'z3 significantly more accurate';
- contamination without MDE;
- the n/label-sha bookkeeping, the $9.83 > $9.50 overshoot, and the 11 judge JSON failures.
The evaluation artifact already produced the corrected numbers: tables/mustfix_{A,C,D,E}.csv, bookkeeping.csv, frontier_same_item.csv, judge_matched_fa.csv, contamination.csv (MDE 0.12–0.21), invariance_set_overlap.csv (NOT_SAME_SET), coverage_vs_request.csv, function_inventory.csv, and step 11 ('gen_art_experiment_2 … the executor never started'). The report does not carry them back.
  Action: For each of last round's nine MUST-FIX items, edit the iteration-1 text in place. Keep the original sentence struck through, followed by '[Correction, iter 2: …; source gen_art_evaluation_1/tables/<file>.csv]'. Add '1.x Candidate B: planned, never started' citing evaluation step 11. Add the coverage and function-inventory tables from coverage_vs_request.csv and function_inventory.csv.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) §2.3 (Evaluation 1) misdescribes the analysis and leaves out its verdict.
(a) It claims one 'common item set (588 items shared across experiments A, C, D, and E)'. The artifact uses per-regime common sets: R_SOLVER_CONS 373/155 err, R_ADJ_AB 298/165, R_ADJ_A 75/36, R_ADJ_ALL 498/271 (regimes.json). E's held-out rows were firewalled.
(b) It headlines R_ADJ_A: 'FOL-Triage reaches 0.958 and PEER+TEXT 0.932, both well above the judges'. regimes.json marks R_ADJ_A testable=false (n=75, 37 sentences; sign only).
(c) The 'PT' row is the evaluation's screen cross-fitted [c_score, bow_uncarried, l3] preview, not exp 5's frozen fusion. The report presents both as 'PEER+TEXT'.
(d) The flipped-item count is given as 51. 51 is the fused-score n; the transitions are 58 (D), 62 (C) and 55 (A).
(e) The evaluation's central outputs are omitted:
- the iteration-1 decision rule FAILS for fused_H and c_score in every regime;
- fused_H − judge is −0.013 under solver but +0.096 [0.020, 0.171] under A+B;
- PT-screen − judge_cheap_disg is +0.089/+0.104/+0.090/+0.118;
- nested S4+PT is +0.04 to 0.06;
- the permutation null max is 0.087 under A+B, so p≈0.05 with 20 permutations;
- the rank Kendall τ between regimes is 0.60;
- P1 is PARTIAL_STRUCT_UNTESTABLE and P2a/P2b depend on the comparator;
- the exp A L2-bow definition gap is 0.737 vs 0.711.
  Action: Rewrite §2.3 from the evaluation's README headline results. Give each regime's n/n_err/sentences/testable flag. Move R_ADJ_A to a sign-only line. Rename PT to PT-screen. Correct 51→58/62/55. Add the iteration-1 rule verdict table, the Δ-vs-judge table per regime, the nested-S4 row, the placebo nulls and the τ, each with its tables/*.csv path.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Exp 5's tables are only partly transcribed, and the omitted parts change the reading.
- The TEXT column: TEXT 0.693 < local judge 0.712; TEXT − judge −0.019 [−0.065, 0.028]; on CTRL, TEXT − judge = −0.180 [−0.331, −0.022]. The text half of the fusion is WORSE than a local 8B judge.
- PEER (ALIGN g) 0.748, and NF g.
- R_A L20 (0.747), R_A EXC (0.858, with c_score_align 0.898), and R_A L25 / all strata (sign only).
- Per-stratum Δ vs judge: L20 +0.064 [−0.001, 0.129], crossing 0; CTRL −0.031 n.s.
- The within-stratum placebo of 0.59: pooled AUROCs carry about 0.09 of stratum-composition signal, which is why the stratified PT is 0.753, not 0.790.
- NF-fusion − judge +0.047 [0.011, 0.082].
- The judge_cheap_disg and REPRINT columns of the P4 table.
- Family-level τ-b.
- P3 interactions for every metric.
- Deviations D6 (c_score_align screen regression 0.8597 vs 0.866) and D10 (thresholds set in-sample on short screen sentences).
- The 1,106 rows with flash-lite scores vs the '20 items' statement.
  Action: Paste exp 5's results/tables.md sections (a), (a') and the P1-P4 tables in full, and the deviations.json list, under §2.2 with their paths. State the TEXT-vs-judge result and the 0.59 composition placebo in the summary. Lead summary item 1 with the stratified numbers (PT 0.753, c_score_align 0.741, judge 0.677).
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (scope) Coverage against the user's request is still partial, and the report has no coverage table. Gaps:
(1) 'Controlled perturbations of gold formulas with known error types' and 'sensitivity per error type'. PERTURB (4,234 mutants, 868 controls) was built, but no metric was scored on it. Per-type sensitivity on real errors rests on panel/repair-op groupings, with most typed cells < 50.
(2) 'Long, heavily conditioned sentences matter most'. R_COMP was not built. On E the long pool is testable, but only against local judges, and exp 6's complexity table (judge 0.524 at 2 conditions) is absent.
(3) 'Which kind of error'. Unit-code typing is at chance (0.371 vs 0.382). No metric identifies error type, and the report should state this as a negative answer.
(4) 'A large-LLM judge only if shown to earn its cost'. Untestable on E. The screen evidence (+0.166 under A+B, n=90; fails the $0.002 cost gate at $0.0029/call) is not assembled into an answer.
(5) 'Estimate how often gold is wrong / correct-but-not-equivalent'. The estimates exist (dataset E card; exp 6 table 9) but are not in the report.
(6) 'Reusable Python functions with a precise statement of what each measures'. Not listed, although src/peer_text.py, src/fol_triage.py, src/consensus.py, src/b2_world_probe.py and the evaluation's function_inventory.csv exist.
(7) Invariance of PEER+TEXT was measured only on screen pools. On E it was not measured.
  Action: Add a 'Coverage against the request' table built from gen_art_evaluation_1/tables/coverage_vs_request.csv, updated with iteration-2 artifacts: requirement → where answered (section/file) → status (answered / partial / untestable / not run). Add the function inventory. In 'What remains', rank 'score all metrics on PERTURB per operator (the RENAME_SYN and RENAME_NONCE controls separately)' and 'complete R_COMP' above new metric variants.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (clarity) The reasoning behind iteration 2 is not recorded. §2.1 lists three goals, but omits:
- why PEER+TEXT was chosen: upd_hypo says 'lead → deepen' because no candidate beat the judge on the 389 common items and the adjudicated labels flipped the ranking;
- the verbatim hypothesis, which included beating S4 and holding under R_ADJ and R_COMP;
- the five planned artifacts and why each was chosen (gen_strat_1);
- what the previous review objected to, and which objections this iteration answered;
- why g_score (ALIGN) ended up as the PEER feature: the F1 gate failure and pre-registered fallback 3.
The paper step cannot explain the pivot from 'four candidates' to 'one fused object' without this.
  Action: Open §2.1 with a 6-8 line block. Cover the previous review's score and main objections, the upd_hypo decision and its evidence, the hypothesis text, the five planned artifacts with their status (ran / gate-failed / blocked), and the fallback chain actually used (F-KEY → local judge bar; F1 fail → ALIGN g_score).
- [MINOR] (novelty) The iteration's positive result is that a z3-based cross-family consensus, with or without text layers, beats a local 8B judge and a local baseline stack on long held-out sentences. The report does not compare it with its nearest neighbours or size it proportionately:
- The fusion adds nothing significant over c_score_align, the iteration-1 consensus (+0.011 n.s.). So the confirmed finding is 'cross-family z3 consensus generalises to held-out long sentences'.
- That is close to Li et al. (NeurIPS 2024), which uses symbolic equivalence across samples for autoformalization selection, and to SAC3 (cross-model consistency beats self-consistency).
- The bar is a fallback judge weaker than the pre-registered one (0.757 vs 0.777 on the screen).
- The shared-aligner confound with the solver labeller remains open: c_score_align is 0.860 on tier A.
  Action: Add a two-line nearest-neighbour note under §2.2. Name Li et al. 2024, SAC3 and FormalAlign, and state what is new: held-out long MALLS/FOLIO strata, z3-modulo-vocabulary equivalence on NL→FOL, and the beat over a local S4 stack. Frame the result as confirming iteration 1's consensus signal, not a new fused metric. Keep the aligner-confound caveat next to every c_score_align number.
- [MINOR] (clarity) The PERTURB description contradicts dataset 3's card.
- The report lists 12 operators 'including SCOPE, UNGLUE'. The card says SCOPE and UNGLUE have 0 rows, and MEANING_RENAME (498 rows, foreign vocabulary) is an operator.
- QUANT/REV/RESTR are UP-only.
- The report calls every control 'z3-equivalent', but RENAME_SYN/RENAME_NONCE controls are equivalent only modulo renaming, and the solver labels most RENAME_SYN rows ERROR(ADD+DROP).
- The card forbids pooling PERTURB with real errors, and the report omits that rule.
- 'Each perturbation row carries … ERROR for DOWN mutants' omits UP mutants.
  Action: Replace the operator row with the card's per-operator × polarity counts table and the control-type counts (RENAME_NONCE 159, CONTRAPOSITIVE 281, REORDER_COMMUTE 258, RENAME_SYN 141, DEMORGAN 8, REORDER_QUANT 21). Add the card's caveats: synthetic only, never pooled; analyse RENAME_SYN and NONCE separately.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT BUDGET: EXACTLY 5 artifact directions per strategy — fill EVERY slot.**
Not "up to" 5: 5. A short answer is a verification failure and comes back
for another turn, because an unspent slot is a bet the run never placed.

**EVERY ARTIFACT IS A BET.** For each direction, write `what_it_would_show`: the
sentence the paper gets out of it IF IT WORKS — the result, not the activity. A
direction whose success would produce no such sentence does not deserve the slot;
replace it with one that would.

Each strategy should:
1. Establish the FIELD'S REASONING first and write it into `domain_reasoning`, then say in `principle_alignment` which of those principles the strategy follows and which it breaks on purpose
2. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
3. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
4. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

**AIM AT A POSITIVE RESULT.** The strategy's target is a finding the paper
can LEAD with: an effect that is there, a method that beats what came before,
a construction that works, a proof that goes through. Report a null honestly
when you get one — but do not plan toward one. If the evidence so far says
the literal question is a settled negative, do not widen into yet another
screen that will also come back empty. Move SIDEWAYS to the nearest object
that can come out positive: the adjacent phenomenon where the effect should
be strongest, a sharper instrument or detector that would find it if it is
there, the narrower condition under which it does hold, or a result that
holds by construction. State that shift in the strategy's rationale.

**BROADER IS NOT THE SAME AS DEEPER.** This applies when you are going DEEPER
on a claim that already has support — it is not an argument against a wide
screen, which tests DIFFERENT candidate answers rather than the same one in
more places. Adding models, datasets, or settings to an experiment that
already ran makes the table bigger; it does not make the contribution
stronger, and it is the default a strategy generator drifts into when it has
nothing sharper to propose. Spend an artifact on scale only when the SPREAD
itself is the finding (a scaling trend, a regime boundary, a generalisation
claim the paper actually makes). Otherwise spend it on something that could
change the conclusion: the mechanism behind an observed effect, the condition
under which it disappears, the confound that would explain it away, or the
baseline whose absence a reviewer would name first.

IMPORTANT: this task is NOT complete until `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` exists and contains JSON matching the schema above.

I work on converting natural-language text into first-order logic (NL→FOL, autoformalization) with
LLM pipelines. Evaluation is the bottleneck. Correct FOL for a sentence is not unique — different
predicate names, different decompositions of the same concept, and logically equivalent rewrites can
all be correct. Gold FOL annotations are rare and expensive. The metrics in use either need a gold
formula (exact match, BLEU, prover-checked equivalence to the gold) or only check that the output
parses. In my own pilot I used cheap structural metrics: whether a set of generated formulas loads
together without conflicts, whether predicate arities stay consistent, how many predicates are used
but never defined, and how similar the predicate sets are across reruns. Those measure stability and
composability, not whether a formula says what the sentence says.

Find new metrics for NL→FOL output quality. Operating situation: you are given a natural-language
sentence (or short passage) and a candidate FOL formalization produced by any system. There is no gold
formula, no ontology or controlled vocabulary, and no domain knowledge. The metric returns a score
that predicts whether the formalization is faithful to the text, and ideally which kind of error it
contains (quantifier or scope error, dropped or added condition, negation/polarity error, swapped
arguments, conflated or wrongly split concepts). Metrics may score a single formula or a set (several
samples for one sentence, or the formalizations of all sentences in one document). They must be
task-agnostic — usable for any NL→FOL setting, not tied to a domain, dataset or pipeline — and cheap
enough to run on every output (solver calls and small models are fine; a large-LLM judge per formula
only if shown to earn its cost).

Requirements:
- Keep the target fixed: the metric must predict faithfulness to the text. Detecting synthetic
  perturbations, parse validity, or run-to-run stability are not substitutes for that target.
- Validate against ground truth, never against the metric itself. Use public datasets with gold
  sentence-level FOL (e.g. FOLIO, MALLS, or others you find) to build a meta-evaluation set: real
  candidate formalizations from several different systems, plus controlled perturbations of gold
  formulas with known error types, labelled via prover-checked equivalence to gold. Handle two known
  problems: some gold annotations are wrong, and a candidate can be correct without being equivalent
  to the gold (different vocabulary or granularity). Estimate how often each happens and how it
  biases the labels. These datasets are public, so check whether LLM-based metrics benefit from having
  seen the gold.
- For each metric report: correlation with correctness at item and system level; sensitivity per error
  type; invariance under meaning-preserving rewrites (variable/predicate renaming, reordering,
  equivalent restatements); coverage — unparseable outputs are counted and reported, never silently
  dropped; and cost.
- Compare against baselines: parse/compile rate, round-trip (FOL→NL→compare) similarity,
  LLM-as-judge, sampling self-consistency, and the structural consistency metrics described above. A
  new metric matters only if it adds signal those don't.
- Report how each metric's reliability changes with sentence complexity (length, number of quantifiers,
  nesting depth, number of conditions and exceptions). Long, heavily conditioned sentences matter most
  to me.
- Negative results are welcome: if a family of metrics does not track correctness, show that clearly.

Out of scope: comparing grounded vs ungrounded generation (ontology vocabulary injected into prompts),
anything that depends on a particular ontology, and building a better NL→FOL translator. The
contribution is the measurement, not the translator.

Deliverables: reusable Python functions taking (text, fol) — or a set of such pairs — each with a
precise statement of what it measures; the meta-evaluation dataset with its labels; and the results.

I appended a pilot study of this problem with some metrics I already used but haven't verified. Just for reference.

# Neuro-symbolic AI — field handbook (mid-2026)

## Overview
The SUBSTRATE below is the star: a dense, grounded map of the field as of mid-2026 — organizing principles, a theme-balanced frontier, and an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is OPEN QUESTIONS (tensions the reader resolves their own way; no prescribed directions), then a thin execution floor. Every claim resolves to a verbatim quote in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md).

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)
- **No settled integration recipe.** ["To date, no single predominant approach exists"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) [S2]. The shared design-space map is Kautz's coupling taxonomy; the text2logic pattern is type 3 — a ["neural architecture to interpret perceptual data as symbols and relationships that are further reasoned about symbolically"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) [S2].
- **Verification is entering BOTH inference and training.** The 2024–2026 through-line: techniques ["that increasingly connect generation with verification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.08728) [S12] — verification is no longer a post-hoc add-on.
- **Deep work is judged on principled integration serving trust.** The durable framing centers ["trust, safety, interpretability and accountability"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05876) [S4]; the 2024 systematic review (1,428→167 papers) finds ["Explainability and trustworthiness are less represented (28%), with meta-cognition being the least explored area (5%)"](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.05435v1) [S1].
- **The stated scale bottleneck is knowledge acquisition, not inference:** ["knowledge extraction is the main bottleneck"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) computationally at large scale [S2].
- **The field now applies a correction rule to its own headlines:** ["high compilation rates or accuracies should not be equated with faithful reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.19459) [S6][S5] — accuracy gains no longer certify the reasoning behind them.

## Frontier (2025 H2 – 2026 H1, recency-weighted, theme-balanced)

**Text→logic / autoformalization.**
- Scale is not the lever for NL→FOL: ["Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT reasoning ability"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22338); ["predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22338) — the predicate list, not model size, is the lever [S8] (2025-09).
- **Wedge now OCCUPIED (rank it down):** gold-free certification of autoformalization exists — ["We propose a roundtrip verification approach which does not require ground-truth annotations: formalize a statement, translate the result back to natural language, re-formalize, and use a formal tool to check logical equivalence."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.25031) [S9] (2026-04, SMT-community authors). Proposing gold-free roundtrip certification as novel re-treads this.
- The "LLMs can't do NL→FOL" premise is being walked back — ["recent literature provides contrasting results"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11816), but sentence-level translation is largely handled [S23] (2025-11) → crowded lane 4.

**LLM+solver coupling.**
- The intermediate representation is a live design axis: reframing math reasoning as verifiable code (SymPy) moves failures from opaque fallacies to transparent program errors, ["demonstrating significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over baselines"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25975) [S11] (2025-10).
- Formalize-everything, forward-only pipelines are the diagnosed failure shape — they ["often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03360); the 2025-12 counter-design couples selective, confidence-aware translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning [S20].

**Probabilistic / differentiable NeSy.**
- Normative result, live controversy: the independence assumption (the tractability trick in DeepProbLog/Scallop-style predictors) formally ["entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain concept combinations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11357) [S14] (2025-07).
- Adoption is bottlenecked by tooling, not algorithms: ["A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07122)-solving [S15] (2025-09).

**Benchmarks & eval methodology.**
- Benchmark-validity result: canonical NL→FOL gold is broken — ["approximately 39% and 36% of entries, respectively, contain incorrect FOL formalizations (i.e., ground truth labels)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.02837) in FOLIO and MALLS; corrected labels shift model accuracy +9–22pp, so scores on the originals partly measure annotation noise [S13] (2026-06).
- Eval is shifting from one-gold-proof to multi-path: LogicGraph ships solver-verified instances ["where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21044) [S19] (2026-02).

**Faithfulness / auditable traces** *(hottest thread — deliberately capped here; see crowded list).*
- Formal structure raises accuracy, yet ["this gain does not imply faithful reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16118): scope laundering — reporting solver-inconsistent verdicts without executing the formal reasoning — ["persists across all models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16118) [S5] (2026-06, COLM-2026 under review).
- Baseline-correcting dissent: under UNIFIED generation there is ["no evidence of systematic gaming in unified generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.19459) — ["models prefer reporting failure over forcing proofs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.19459); unfaithfulness surfaces in the TWO-STAGE split and differs by model (axiom fabrication vs premise mistranslation that evades detection) [S6] (2026-04). Reading this paper as "models game formalization" is a documented misreading.
- Per-step trace validation exists: VeriCoT formalizes each CoT step to FOL and types its grounding premise (source / commonsense / prior step); validity ["serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662) [S10] (2025-11).
- Terminology (single 2-author preprint — lead only): ["a formal statement can typecheck and be provable, yet still encode a different theorem than the source intended."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16541) [S7] (2026-06).

**Ontology / KG grounding.**
- **Wedge PARTLY OCCUPIED — and this section's one peer-reviewed anchor:** pretrained NL-term embeddings collide with formal ontology term syntax (SUMO/SUO-KIF), so models ["produce syntactic errors or hallucinate non-existent terms due to conflicting embeddings learned during base training"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v284/thompson25a.html); a tokenization fix mitigates it [S18] (NeSy 2025, PMLR v284). "Ontology as a faithfulness lever" is no longer blank space.
- Ontology-grounded pipelines are being positioned for high-assurance domains (law/medicine), whose reasoning is ["inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01530) — grounding as an assurance lever, not just background knowledge [S16] (2025-10).

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed)
- **ProverGen/ProverQA** (ICLR 2025): prover-synthesized FOL eval — scalable, contamination-resistant, with ["accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06563); ["state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06563) [S25] (2025-02).
- **NL2FOL** (2024-05): the named key challenge is ["the integration of implicit background knowledge"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02318) [S32].
- **GSM-Symbolic** (2024-10): pure-neural reasoning is perturbation-fragile — ["Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229) [S29].
- **AlphaGeometry** (Nature 2024): the field's flagship result — the 2024 review found ["only one entry at the intersection of all 4 of the main research focal areas"](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.05435v1): AlphaGeometry [S1][S28].

## Durable core (foundations an expert still leans on)
- **Logic-LM / LINC** (2023) — the canonical parser+solver pattern: the LLM translates; ["These expressions are then offloaded to an external theorem prover, which symbolically performs deductive inference."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15164) [S26][S24]. Self-refinement = the solver's error messages fed back [S24].
- **DeepProbLog / DeepStochLog / Scallop / Logic Tensor Networks** — settled probabilistic-differentiable canon; know them, do not re-propose them [S1][S2].
- **Kautz coupling taxonomy + Garcez & Lamb third-wave framing** — the field's shared vocabulary [S2][S4].

## Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)
Saturated threads with strong 2025–26 work; adding to them is incremental. The blank space is NOT here:
1. **Accuracy ≠ faithfulness diagnosis** — the gap is documented across [S5][S6][S7]; merely diagnosing it again is months late. Nuance inside the lane: the "formalization gaming" headline is already contested [S6].
2. **Interventional / counterfactual faithfulness** — a named lane: RFEval [S21]; Executable Counterfactuals — which itself notes existing evals ["tend to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01539) [S17]; label-flip evaluation with judge-model selection (Truth-or-Twist [S22] — a judge-selection study, not a proof-DAG benchmark).
3. **Proof-DAG / counterfactual-twin benchmarks** — LogicGraph already ships solver-verified, exhaustive minimal-proof sets [S19]; LogiConBench is a further lead (403-blocked; candidate lane).
4. **Bare NL→FOL translators** — saturated since Logic-LM/LINC 2023 [S24][S26]; ["state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11816) [S23]. Another translator is incremental.
5. **Per-axiom / per-step source-grounded ATTESTATION at the formalization seam** — grounding each formal atom or CoT step in an identified source premise + a solver/entailment check is an occupied lane: VeriCoT types each step's grounding premise and finds validity ["serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662) [S10], and premise-correspondence / scope-laundering checks already probe the same seam [S5][S7]. "Gate every premise against the source" re-treads this — the open move is what these do NOT do (e.g. defeating *shared-bias* mistranslation, not just per-premise support).
6. **Reverse-direction / NL-first, solver-certified benchmarks** — real-text (not template) inputs, expert-audited + Z3-checked, scored on formalization faithfulness: an active 2026 lane — LLMEval-Logic ["verifies annotated answers with Z3, constructs expert rubrics for natural-to-formal grading"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.19597) [S33]. "A reverse-direction certified benchmark" as the contribution re-treads it; only a distinct axis (e.g. a synthetic→natural transfer diagnostic) stays open.

## Open questions the field hasn't answered (the whole lens — answer in your own way)
1. Canonical pipelines equated accuracy boosts with ["a promising avenue for faithful logical reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12295) [S24]; 2026 evidence shows the gain ["does not imply faithful reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16118) [S5]. What property should a text→logic system be optimized and reported on — and what evidence would let a faithfulness claim survive both [S5]'s divergence protocol and [S6]'s two-stage protocol?
2. A solver in the loop is assumed to transfer soundness to the user-visible answer — ["a solver produces a sound and independently verifiable answer"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.19588) — yet ["the soundness guarantee can be lost in the interaction between the solver and the model"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.19588) [S27], scope laundering ["persists across all models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16118) [S5], while a Lean-4 study finds no systematic gaming under unified generation [S6]. Where along NL → formalization → execution → reported answer does soundness actually leak, and what task / pipeline-split / model differences reconcile the clashing results?
3. Per-step validators exist [S10] and roundtrip equivalence certification covers translation [S9], but there is no agreed gold-free faithfulness metric (as of 2026-07). What would a gold-free, process-level faithfulness measure have to certify for the field to accept it as a primary reported number?
4. Prover-synthesis provides gold chains [S25] and exhaustive minimal-proof sets [S19], while hand-curated gold is ~36–39% wrong [S13] — yet accuracy is still the primary reported metric. What blocks process-level scoring from becoming the default, and what would unblock it?
5. The independence assumption is ubiquitous for tractability yet formally ["entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain concept combinations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11357) [S14]. Where does this limitation actually bite on realistic tasks — and does the community's scepticism that it rarely matters hold up?
6. An upper ontology is assumed to supply clean background structure, but peer-reviewed evidence shows NL-term embeddings collide with formal term syntax, yielding hallucinated terms [S18], while high-assurance framings demand defeasible, evidence-grounded reasoning [S16]. What is ontology grounding actually good for in an LLM-era pipeline — and at what integration cost?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)
| Deep / killed | Contrast | Separating cue · reopening condition | src |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AlphaGeometry (Nature 2024): dissolved the structural bottleneck (proof-data scarcity) — ["sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5) | AlphaGeometry2: same recipe scaled/tuned — ["we have significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AG to 84%"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03544) (from 54%) | deep = attack the bottleneck so a new capability becomes possible; incremental = push the same paradigm's number | [S28][S31] |
| killed: the bare NL→FOL translator as the contribution | dismissal (2025-11): SOTA dialogue LLMs translate sentence-level logic well [S23] | reopen where translation still fails: beyond sentence level (long documents; dense modal/temporal/higher-order logic), or where ["embedding-centric models perform markedly worse"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11816) | [S23] |
| killed: purely-neural end-to-end reasoners | dismissal (2024-10): ["current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229); compositional collapse [S30] | reopen only on demonstrated out-of-distribution, clause-count-robust reasoning that clears the GSM-Symbolic bar | [S29][S30] |
| killed: trusting FOLIO/MALLS original gold labels | dismissal (2026-06): ~39%/36% incorrect formalizations [S13] | reopen via the released corrected splits — relabeling framework reached ["90% dataset accuracy after reviewing fewer than 24% of instances"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.02837) | [S13] |

The line as THIS field draws it: contributions are weighed on principled integration serving trust/interpretability [S4], and the under-served areas (explainability & trust ~28%, meta-cognition ~5% [S1]) are where work reads deep — not another accuracy point on a saturated translator [S23].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)
| Naive move | Expert move | Why (failure prevented) | src |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluate NL→FOL on FOLIO/MALLS as shipped | Use the corrected re-annotations or prover-synthesized sets; state which labels you scored on | ~39%/36% wrong gold; +9–22pp label-noise swings → wrong-result | [S13][S25] |
| Read compilation / typecheck / accuracy as faithfulness evidence | Measure faithfulness separately, on the reported answer | compilation rates ≉ faithful reasoning [S6]; typecheck+provable can encode a different theorem [S7] → wrong-result | [S6][S5][S7] |
| Default to prompting the largest reasoning LLM for NL→FOL | Also benchmark a fine-tuned small encoder-decoder and supply the predicate list | predicate availability +15–20%; T5-XXL beats GPT-4o / R1-0528 → wasted-cost | [S8] |
| Formalize the whole document and forward-chain | Weigh selective, confidence-aware translation and hypothesis-driven backward reasoning | forward-only: redundant paths, hallucinated steps, semantic drift → wrong-result | [S20] |
| Assume ontology terms ground cleanly | Test formal-term grounding separately (NL-embedding / term-syntax collision) | hallucinated non-existent terms in SUO-KIF-style languages → wrong-result | [S18] |
| Score reasoning against one gold proof chain | Account for alternate minimal proofs (multi-path eval) | penalizes valid derivations; distorts process scores → wrong-result | [S19] |

## Decision guide
- **Benchmark choice:** template sets (RuleTaker/ProofWriter) when you need scale + control and accept shortcut risk; FOLIO/MALLS ONLY with corrected labels [S13]; ProverQA for contamination-resistant, chain-accessible eval [S25]; LogicGraph when multiple valid proofs matter [S19].
- **Intermediate representation:** verifiable code (SymPy-style) when the domain is computational math [S11]; logic forms when deduction/entailment is itself the object [S24][S26].
- **Probabilistic substrate:** independence-assuming predictors (DeepProbLog/Scallop lane) buy tractability but formally cannot represent uncertainty over some concept combinations [S14] — decide by whether that uncertainty is load-bearing for the task.
- **Sourcing:** most 2025–26 results above are arXiv preprints; [S18] (PMLR) and the 2023–25 EMNLP/ICLR/Nature anchors are the peer-reviewed exceptions — prefer published versions for load-bearing claims (volatile.md tracks status).

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)
- LLM = semantic parser, solver = deterministic inference — the Logic-LM/LINC division of labor [S24][S26].
- Self-refinement = feed the solver's error messages back to revise formalizations [S24].
- NL→FOL's named key challenge: implicit background knowledge the text leaves unstated [S32].
- Template benchmarks: scalable but simplistic; hand-curated: small + contamination-prone; prover-synthesis is the scalable route [S25].
- Scope laundering = reporting a solver-inconsistent verdict without executing the formal reasoning; sibling failure modes: implicit-constraint blindness, program-synthesis errors [S5].
- text2logic sits at Kautz type 3 ("Neural | Symbolic") on the coupling map [S2].
- Knowledge extraction is the stated main computational bottleneck at scale [S2].

## Reference documentation
- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — wedge-occupancy status, peer-review status of load-bearing preprints, venue/edition facts; re-check before any novelty verdict or write-up.
- **[SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md)** — provenance: every [Sn] resolves here with its verbatim quote and scrutiny verdict.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)
- ⚠️ **LogiConBench** (OpenReview forum id ULEHJkolxB; reportedly ICLR 2026, controllable-depth reasoning graphs) — PDF returned HTTP 403 during mining; lead only. If confirmed, it further crowds lane 3. Confirm via OpenReview.
- ⚠️ **FRIT** (intervention-training for faithfulness) and **SATBench** (EMNLP 2025) — named by the tool-equipped baseline, not independently fetched; their lanes are confirmed by [S21][S19] regardless. Fetch abstracts before citing either.
- ⚠️ **Driftbench** — real: 2,183 NL/Lean-4 ["pairs with controlled drift labels across six subfields of mathlib4"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16541), released by [S7], NOT by the formalization-gaming paper a search snippet attributed it to; [S7] is a quality-flagged single preprint, so treat as a lead until corroborated.
- ⚠️ **NeSy 2026 logistics** (Lisbon, Sep 1–4; PMLR; OpenReview, 10pg full / 5pg short; X-NeSy special issue) — from a live baseline fetch whose quote was not retained. Confirm at nesyconf.org before venue planning.

[Message from staff account 'staff', not the run's owner]

Guidance for round 3 from the platform owner. The strongest open gap in this study is the pre-registered comparison against API LLM judges on the 8.5k held-out set, which was skipped in round 2 when the OpenRouter budget ran out. Please make round 3's strategy close it: (1) run the pre-registered cheap API judges (gemini flash-lite and gpt-4.1-nano) on the 8.5k held-out set within the remaining test budget (about $4.6; estimate the cost first and pre-declare any subsampling); (2) refit the stacked metric and peer-plus-text on the same items and report the head-to-head AUROC with bootstrap CIs; (3) score the dataset_3 suite of 4,234 deliberately broken formulas with every metric; (4) reuse experiment_6's finished feature files and folds marked FOR ITERATION 3 under 3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_6 instead of recomputing them. Keep the pre-registration and report honestly whichever way it comes out.
