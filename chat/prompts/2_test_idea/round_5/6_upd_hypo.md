## Task: `upd_hypo` (terminal_claude_agent)

### [1] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-24 16:16:23 UTC

```
 ungrounded generation (ontology vocabulary injected into prompts),
anything that depends on a particular ontology, and building a better NL→FOL translator. The
contribution is the measurement, not the translator.

Deliverables: reusable Python functions taking (text, fol) — or a set of such pairs — each with a
precise statement of what it measures; the meta-evaluation dataset with its labels; and the results.

I appended a pilot study of this problem with some metrics I already used but haven't verified. Just for reference.

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviser (Step 3.6: UPD_HYPO in the invention loop)

You received the current hypothesis, all artifacts, and the paper draft.
Revise the hypothesis based on what the evidence supports.

Honest revision → focused research. Inflated confidence → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

You are deciding where a research run points next, using the evidence it
gathered this iteration. Your revised hypothesis IS the next iteration's
hypothesis — nothing else steers the run — so this is a steering decision
first and a piece of honest reflection second.

SCOPE: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. You do NOT run code,
produce artifacts, fix bugs, or otherwise act on the evidence yourself — the
next iteration of the invention loop will spawn fresh artifacts based on your
revised hypothesis. Reflect on the evidence and rewrite the hypothesis;
nothing else.

PRINCIPLES:
- Ground every revision in specific artifacts and results. A number that was
  projected, assumed or left as a placeholder is not a result.
- CLASSIFY EVERY ARTIFACT SEPARATELY, BEFORE CHOOSING A MOVE. One artifact
  is one bet. A round is normally MIXED, and judging the round as a whole is
  how one real positive gets thrown out with the nulls beside it. The round
  summary is then READ OFF the best of those verdicts, and the move follows
  from the summary and the remaining budget by a fixed rule — not by free
  judgement, because free judgement is where past runs went wrong.
- LATCH ONTO A GENUINE POSITIVE. One executed, non-obvious, baseline-proof
  result at a size the ask cares about is the run's whole output. Hold it,
  and spend the next round on its mechanism, its boundary, its confounds and
  its replication. Do not go looking for a different question while it lives.
- WEAK IS NOT NULL. A small real effect, a positive that lost to a baseline
  by a margin, a signal seen on one body of evidence — these are LEADS. The
  answer to a lead is to make it bigger and cleaner, not to abandon it. Widen
  off a lead only after deepening it has come back empty.
- A round where NOTHING is real is the signal to go WIDER, not smaller. The
  question the user asked is still open; the answer you tried is the only
  thing that was refuted, and every next bet should be a different answer to
  the ask.
- Never shrink the claim until the effect you happened to observe becomes
  the claim. A finding nobody needed is worse than an honest negative.
- A broken test is fixed ONCE, with the claim unchanged. A bet that breaks
  twice is dropped, and its budget goes to a new candidate.
- The run is looking for a POSITIVE, NON-OBVIOUS result. A clean negative is
  a LAST RESORT, right only when no iteration and no candidate remain.
- Increase specificity as evidence accumulates; do not inflate confidence
  without strong evidence.
- Revise hypothesis text only — never attempt to address feedback by running
  code, proposing fixes, or producing artifacts; the next loop iteration
  handles all artifact generation.

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_5/upd_hypo/upd_hypo`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_5/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_5/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_5/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Name each kept artifact in your results and your `README.md` by its path
RELATIVE to your cwd, and say it stays on the run's volume rather than in the
published repository. Never write an absolute server path into a file that is
published: a reader's machine has none of them.

<current_hypothesis>
The hypothesis as it stands. Revise it based on the evidence below.

kind: hypothesis
title: Cross-model agreement, tested on fresh data
hypothesis: |-
  kind: hypothesis (iteration 5 of 5, FINAL). Move = DEEPEN on the one live lead: cross-family solver consensus (frozen c_score_align, with PT = p_peer_text as its fused row). The lead gets its first test on data no earlier decision touched. The two confirmation sets that the budget broke in iteration 4 (E2, and the R_COMP FREE gloss labels) are each FIXED ONCE, with their claims unchanged. The lead's false-alarm cause, which iteration 4 re-diagnosed as wrong and scattered peers rather than vocabulary, is attacked with $0 development-screened variants. Candidate-Signature Consensus (CSC) is CLOSED. The paper is then written from the corrected record below.

  ========================================================================
  0. CORRECTED RECORD (the paper step TRANSCRIBES these numbers; each has a source)
  ========================================================================

  0.1 DATA ROLES
  - E, the screen, R_COMP SIG and PERTURB are DEVELOPMENT data. Every number from them is development evidence. The paper must NEVER call E 'held-out'.
  - The only untouched confirmation evidence is:
    - E2: sealed; seal.json and verify_seal.py are in gen_art_dataset_4;
    - the R_COMP FREE untouched subset (2,198 rows; seal b364a49a…, gen_art_dataset_5).

  0.2 ITERATION 3, CORRECTED
  The iter-3 record in iter_3/upd_hypo §0 is authoritative, together with the eval-3 Part-4 tables in gen_art_evaluation_3/tables/: hypothesis_verdicts_iter3.csv, perturb_corrected.csv, t2_record.csv, rename_selection_dead_end.csv, cost_units.csv, coverage_vs_request_iter3.csv, function_inventory.csv, label_facts.csv, corrections_iter12.csv, artifact_id_map.csv, prior_art.csv. Essentials:

  T1 (art_7GxreYjATkC5), R_AB n = 2,686 (1,822 ERROR / 864 CORRECT, 292 sentences):
  - c_score_align strat AUROC 0.741 vs flash-lite disguised 0.642: Δ +0.099 [0.049, 0.146].
    - long pool +0.116 [0.070, 0.163]; EXC +0.197; vs nano original +0.089 [0.043, 0.134].
  - L25 (the user's priority stratum): Δ +0.069 [−0.020, 0.148], n.s.
  - CTRL −0.069 [−0.23, 0.10].
  - Against the baseline stack:
    - c alone ≈ S4_full: +0.006 [−0.031, 0.042];
    - nested [S4_full + c] − S4_full: strat +0.039 [0.021, 0.057].
  - Frontier frame (n = 284):
    - AUROC: judge 0.741, S4_full 0.745, c 0.710;
    - ratio 0.957 [0.887, 1.034], so the 0.95 bar is met on the point estimate only;
    - nested +0.037 [0.008, 0.066].
  - M3 is INCONCLUSIVE because its two specifications conflict: bootstrap +0.146 [−0.051, 0.361] vs stacked GEE +0.274 [0.190, 0.359].
  - Flash-lite contamination DiD +0.105 [0.006, 0.201]: marginal evidence of contamination.
  - Spend $2.395.

  T2 (art_cxnoDYQNFolW), NOT CONFIRMED:
  - SIG passes: 0.954 vs 0.587; +0.278 vs the original judge. But SIG is the controlled-vocabulary regime the user excluded.
  - FREE was NOT_TESTABLE.
  - [Correction, iter 4] The iter-3 FREE tier-A deltas (c_align − judge +0.214; 'falls to ~0.80') are VOID. Those labels over-call ERROR: 297 of 420 old ERROR rows are MAPPED (gen_art_dataset_5/results/old_label_agreement.json).

  Exp 8 (art_YYD-HDzfQfEj):
  - The pre-registered rename-invariant selection FAILED (HYB 0.841/0.700, NF 0.686/0.485).
  - MEANING_RENAME is an ERROR operator, and c_nf is blind to it (0.499).
  - Per-operator consensus AUROC is a base-endorsement artefact. Do not rank operators by it, and do not claim 'polarity symmetry'.
  - Coverage 3,419 of 5,402 rows.
  - Typing: peer-medoid 0.328 vs judge 0.326; the gold-using oracle reaches 0.802.

  Eval 2 (art_FWy8D4_y9GBn), pre-registered definitions:
  - M1 INCONCLUSIVE; M2 CONFIRMED but non-specific; M4 k95 = 3 overall, 2/3/5 by words tercile (long tercile = 5).
  - NET +0.356 [0.198, 0.493]: consensus DEGRADES with length.
  - SCATTER ratio 4.45; graded − binary +0.114.

  Costs (cost_units.csv):
  - consensus $1.21e-4 per candidate FULL;
  - k = 1/3/5/7 pools: $0.000315 / 0.000946 / 0.001576 / 0.002206 per SENTENCE;
  - flash-lite $4.9e-5 per call; frontier $3.65e-3 per item;
  - SIG generation $0.000116 per candidate; MARGINAL z3 $2.5e-7.
  - The old '$0.000024–0.000170 per sentence' column is wrong.

  Prior art (art_VIF75I5R6f0v; needs its own section and marker in the paper):
  - Not scooped. The method is not new: ARc 2511.09008 uses the same score form; NoTB 2608.21962; GenV 2609.11085 reports a label-target reversal; LLMs-as-Jury recommends 3-4 families.
  - C1 and C3-C5 need qualifiers (prior_art.csv).
  - Iter-3 spend $4.33 (not '$1.58 plus T1').

  0.3 ITERATION 4, the record per artifact (spend from ledgers)

  A. Exp 9, CSC on E (art_D7k2ZWgE3nVd; tables.md T0-T17; csc_gate_E.json). PROVISIONAL.
  Population and selection:
  - The platform refused paid calls after 1,033 of ~9,000 planned. PRIMARY is therefore a COMPLETION-SELECTED subset: 354 R_AB rows (196 ERROR / 158 CORRECT, 144 sentences).
  - CTRL makes up 44.9% of PRIMARY CORRECT rows vs 27.4% on FULL.
  - No stratum reaches 50/50, so L25 is NOT_READ.
  - c_csc tie rate is 0.986.

  Strat AUROC [CIs as in T4]:
  | Metric | Strat AUROC |
  |-|-|
  | c_csc | 0.614 [0.493, 0.736] |

  | flash-lite disguised | 0.664 [0.568, 0.750] |
  | HYB_MEAN | 0.709 [0.586, 0.817] |

  Paired Δ for c_csc (T5):
  - vs FREE_exact −0.156 [−0.290, −0.031];
  - vs c_score_align −0.160 [−0.275, −0.064];
  - vs flash-lite −0.050 [−0.212, 0.107], n.s.;
  - vs S4_full −0.123 [−0.269, 0.010], n.s.;
  - phi-4 exemplar leakage removed (T17, 58 CSC calls copied the exemplar): c_csc_clean 0.639; vs FREE_exact −0.132 [−0.251, −0.023].

  e and d:
  - CSC e 0.459 vs FREE_exact 0.173; CSC d 0.139 vs 0.323.
  - FULL T2: FREE_exact d 0.583 vs ALIGN 0.328.

  Anchoring by class (T9, PRIMARY; e_CSC / e_FREE_exact / e_FREE_ALIGN):
  | Class | e_CSC | e_FREE_exact | e_FREE_ALIGN |
  |-|-|-|-|
  | ADD | 0.490 | 0.135 | 0.375 |
  | DROP | 0.472 | 0.169 | 0.380 |

  | structural | 0.336 | 0.153 | 0.282 |
  | polarity | 0.200 | 0.133 | 0.200 |
  - MEANING_RENAME-type Δ CSC − FREE_ALIGN is +0.071 [−0.083, 0.269], NOT_READ.
  - FULL T9b: FREE_ALIGN e on MEANING_RENAME-type is 0.624, vs 0.104 for exact.
  - READING: every vocabulary bridge (the aligner, or peers cued with the candidate's symbols) lowers d AND raises e, class by class. The aligner that c_score_align uses already endorses meaning-rename errors almost as often as CSC does.

  Gates (the text of prereg_csc_E.json):
  - G1 FAIL: d 0.139 ≤ 0.35, but the words slope is +1.25 [0.41, 2.09].
  - G2 = 'strat ≥ c_score_align − 0.01 AND pooled > c_score_align on L25' → NOT_READ (the R_AB part FAILS; L25 Δ −0.067 [−0.183, 0.040], n = 81, not read).
  - G3-E = RENAME_SYN false alarm: NOT_RUN.
  - G4 null.
  - G5 PASS: $5.25e-4 per candidate ($2.76e-4 deduped).

  Length:
  - M3 bootstrap −0.232 [−0.770, −0.023]; stacked GEE −0.351 [−0.694, −0.009].
  - NET is length degradation WITHIN each arm, and every arm degrades: FULL FREE_exact +0.452, FREE_align +0.401.

  Other tables:
  - T8: 53% of free-exact disagreements with CORRECT candidates are structural; only 20.2% of flagged CORRECT rows are fully vocabulary-resolvable.
  - T10 typing: own_majority 0.185, below the majority class 0.262.
  - T14: CSC τ-b 0.256 (p = 0.25) vs c_score_align 0.513 (p = 0.015).
  - T15: 9-peer c_score_align rename FA 0.595 → 0.868, ΔFA +0.273 [0.164, 0.384].
  - Spend $0.108.
  - Prior art: this is the correlated-failure mode of Chen & Avizienis 1978. What is new is the per-class e measurement and the bridge-trades-d-for-e table.

  B. Exp 10, CSC on PERTURB (art_pAmLrGqsmFUx). BROKEN: 0 CSC peers were generated ($0.0000088). G3-P, G4 and MT are UNTESTED.
  Zero-cost arms:
  - SIGPROXY (out-of-scope controlled vocabulary): k = 3 within-template 0.930 [0.916, 0.943]; d 0.149 cued vs 0.757 uncued FREE3-ALIGN.
  - Prior art for the shared-vocabulary lever: Vossel et al. 2025 ('predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%') and ARc's fixed schema. The only addition here is a measured d reduction on long templated sentences, in an excluded regime.

  CORRECTIONS:
  - FREE-consensus mutant recall ≈ 1 comes with base FA at c > 0.5 of:
    - 0.712 (c_align_exp8, E);
    - 0.803 (FREE3_exact, E);
    - 0.986 (FREE3_exact, R_COMP);
    - 0.757 (FREE3_align, R_COMP).
    So that recall is trivial.
  - Rename-control FA is mostly base FA. The paired flips are 0.18-0.53 (c_align E: SYN 0.182, NONCE 0.327).
  - LOCAL2 e 0.341 comes entirely from insufficient-peer ties at c = 0.5 (e_excl 0.012/0.007).
  - The judge's 12.4% mutant miss rate is NOT END_MAJ e.
  - Typing:
    - 'oracle' repairs against the gold base, so it is NOT gold-free;
    - free3 on E is 0.123 [0.081, 0.169]; the pooled 0.085 includes R_COMP rows at 0.
  - Split the controls by base source: FREE3_exact REORDER/CONTRA is 0.842/0.840 on E and 0.986 on R_COMP.
  - Uncued d by words tercile: 0.47 / 0.80 / 0.91.

  C. Dataset 4, E2 (art_2OmxzMInZZJY). BROKEN (budget stop).
  - 550 sentences frozen: L25 350, EXC 100 (92 'without' + 8 'but not'; the core-exception supply is exhausted, D3), DT 100 (ProverQA).
  - 30-sentence pilot: 300 candidates, labelled 36 ERROR / 274 UNRESOLVED (incl. gold-as-system) / 20 UNPARSEABLE / 0 CORRECT.
  - Panel drift check:
    - the stop rule is UNDECIDED (passes = false; combined majority agreement 0.394);
    - synthetic gate items 0.974;
    - on 22 unambiguous track-H judgements, today's panel flags 0.12 of original errors vs 0.84 in E: a DRIFT WARNING on small n.
  - Deviations D0-D7 must be listed.
  - Spend $0.241.
  - Power (eval 3):
    - L25 yield 0.37, so 350 L25 gives MDE80 0.110;
    - +0.069 on L25 needs ~882 planned sentences;
    - the long pool needs ~237 usable sentences.

  D. Dataset 5, R_COMP FREE labels (art_Ia_FT284H33j). BROKEN for its purpose: the gloss step was not run, so the CORRECT class is empty.
  - Search-only labels: ERROR_CERT 759, MAPPED 1,506, UNPARSEABLE 188, NO_OUTPUT 199.
  - Search soundness: 0 of 1,595 false ERROR_CERT on SIG renames; known-ERROR rescue 9-10% (T8 0.27; T9 0.37-0.43).
  - Audit: ERROR_CERT precision 0.867; MAPPED faithful 0.867. One MAPPED certificate swaps LivesIn and StudentInClass.
  - Old iter-3 labels are contaminated by UP TO 70.7%. MAPPED is an upper bound. Old/new kappa is 0.058.
  - D6 amended the map family after the freeze. Spend $0.

  E. Eval 3 (art_BvAL_KZTZuw8), $0.
  - MAIN FINDING: among pairs of a CORRECT candidate and a non-agreeing peer, 77% (9-family) / 61% (3-pool) of those peers are labelled ERROR. Only 9% of CORRECT-CORRECT disagreements are vocabulary-resolvable.
  - Pair classes: IRREDUCIBLE 69.4%, EXACT 13.6%, ALIGN_ONLY 15.1%, VOCAB 1.6%.
  - The no-anchoring oracle d floor:
    - 3-pool 0.385;
    - L25 0.542 vs END_MAJ 0.735;
    - 9-family 0.586 > END_MAJ 0.537, because most peers are wrong.
  - The post-hoc instruments predict almost no fix: bracket [0.396, 0.415]; the gap_closed rule is ill-conditioned (denominator 0.013).
  - The instruments are shown to UNDER-COUNT vocabulary effects: predicted endorsement 0.20 vs actual SIG 0.575, calibration error −0.372 [−0.423, −0.323].
    - SIG also changes granularity (D7), so the SIG−FREE agreement drop of +0.479 [0.447, 0.513] is an upper bound.
    - Non-transitivity (0.131) is a separate diagnostic.
  - The number 0.683 is d under the exact rule on E's 3-pool. It is NOT an AUROC and NOT R_COMP. Delete 'theoretical AUROC 0.683'.
  - c_vres on L25: −0.014 [−0.028, −0.001].
  - NET DEGRADES under every rule (+0.35 to +0.39).
  - VOCAB agreements are not label-specific.
  - R_COMP FREE needs ≥ 200 CORRECT rows.

  F. Iteration-4 spend: $0.108 + $0.0000088 + $0.241 + $0 + $0 ≈ $0.35. The rest of the $7 'Test idea' phase budget was consumed by processes recorded in NO iteration-4 artifact ledger. The paper states this and does not guess.

  ========================================================================
  1. WHAT THE EVIDENCE NOW SAYS (the revised diagnosis)
  ========================================================================
  The lead stands on development data: consensus beats cheap judges on long and exception sentences, and it adds signal over the stack only when nested. It is not confirmed on untouched data, and not on L25. The iteration-3 diagnosis said consensus fails on long sentences because CORRECT translations disagree about WORDS. Iteration 4 REFUTES that as the dominant cause on real LLM outputs (E):
  - 61-77% of the disagreement a correct candidate meets comes from peers that are themselves WRONG;
  - only 9% of correct-correct disagreement is vocabulary.
  - Every vocabulary bridge trades d for e:
    - the aligner: d 0.583 → 0.328, but meaning-rename e 0.104 → 0.624;
    - candidate-signature cues: d → 0.139, but e → 0.459, the anchoring.
  - CSC fails provisionally, and the aligner already carries much of the same anchoring cost.

  Vocabulary divergence is real in templated free-vocabulary text (R_COMP: exact agreement 0.048 FREE vs 0.528 SIG). But on real long sentences the binding constraint is PEER ACCURACY: on L25 about 80% of candidates are wrong, so a correct candidate's class is a small plurality.

  Candidate one-sentence finding, if iteration 5 confirms: 'Cross-family solver agreement is a gold-free faithfulness check that beats cheap LLM judges on long, conditioned sentences at ~$1e-4 per candidate. Where it fails, the cause is that the other models are wrong in different ways, not that correct translations use different words. Any device that makes peers share the candidate's vocabulary lowers false alarms only by making peers copy the candidate's errors.'

  ========================================================================
  2. CLAIMS FOR ITERATION 5 (all metrics frozen and hashed BEFORE any confirmation label is joined)
  ========================================================================

  H-PRIMARY (pre-declared in iteration 3; NOT re-selected). On E2 and on R_COMP FREE, the frozen c_score_align:
  - uses the E2 10-slot pool, leave-own-family-out, with the exp-5 code byte-identical;
  - is compared with the flash-lite rubric-A judge (disguised AND original) and with gpt-4.1-nano.
  p_peer_text is a secondary row, frozen.

  H-MECH (the label-based replication of the iter-4 diagnosis; no instrument needed). On E2 CORRECT candidates:
  - (i) ≥ 50% of non-agreeing peers are labelled ERROR;
  - (ii) SCATTER ratio SI_cor / SI_err ≥ 2;
  - (iii) NET Δ(e+d) over the words terciles is > 0 (degradation replicates);
  - (iv) exact vs ALIGN on E2 FULL reproduces the trade: ALIGN has lower d and higher e on MEANING_RENAME-type and ADD/DROP errors.

  H-IMPROVE (the deepen on the cause; a DEVELOPMENT screen at $0, on E's stored pairwise matrix, 29,107 pairs). The mechanism is that wrong peers scatter (they agree with few others), so a correct candidate's plurality is diluted by them. So a score that discounts scattered or unreliable peers should lower d on long sentences WITHOUT raising e. Unlike CSC and the aligner, it changes no peer output and bridges no vocabulary.

  Candidates screened, all label-free:
  - V1 plurality-normalised: c_pn = 1 − share_agree / max_class_share among the sentence's peers;
  - V2 reliability-weighted: per-family weights from mean pairwise agreement across ALL sentences (Dawid-Skene-style, label-free), estimated out of sentence fold;
  - V3 = V1 + V2;
  - V4 two-channel: a cross-fitted logistic on (c_exact, c_align), trading the aligner's d gain against its e cost;
  - V5 V3 on the eval-2 best 3-pool (cost-matched, $0.001 per sentence);
  - V0 the frozen c_score_align.

  Selection rule (pre-registered before running):
  - the winner is the variant with the highest E long-pool strat AUROC that
    - beats V0 by ≥ +0.015 there,
    - AND is ≥ V0 on L25 (point),
    - AND is ≥ V0 − 0.01 on CTRL.
  - If none qualifies, NO variant is carried and V0 stands alone.
  The winner is a CANDIDATE only; E2 confirms or kills it. Report how many variants were screened (5).

  H-RENAME (the user's invariance requirement, the last attempt on a new mechanism, secondary budget). GLOSS-GATED name-free agreement (GG):
  - A peer agrees with the candidate if they are exactly z3-equivalent, OR if an exhaustive injective symbol map (freelab.equivalent_modulo_vocab_exhaustive) yields equivalence AND a cheap LLM gloss check confirms every non-identity mapped symbol pair is a same-meaning pair in this sentence.
  - This targets exactly why NF/HYB failed: NF cannot tell a synonym from a wrong predicate (0.388 of HYB's extra agreements are label-discordant; MEANING_RENAME 0.499). The gloss adds the lexical meaning test the solver lacks, without cueing peers, so there is no anchoring.
  - The gloss model family for GG MUST differ from the one that labels R_COMP FREE (instrument-sharing firewall). GG is therefore never evaluated on R_COMP FREE.
  - Dev gate on PERTURB E-bases plus E R_AB:
    - RENAME_SYN paired flip ≤ 0.05 and FA ≤ base FA + 0.05;
    - MEANING_RENAME recall at fixed threshold ≥ c_align's − 0.05;
    - E strat AUROC ≥ c_score_align − 0.01.
  - Fail → rename non-invariance of consensus is reported as a measured boundary: c_align PERTURB NONCE/SYN FA 0.765/0.565 with paired flips 0.327/0.182; 9-peer ΔFA +0.273. No further rename work.

  ========================================================================
  3. WORK ORDER AND BUDGET (each sweep costed before it runs; stop when the next sweep's estimate exceeds the remainder minus a 10% reserve)
  ========================================================================
  P1. R_COMP FREE gloss (FIX ONCE; the panel route stays dropped). About $0.8-1.8.
  - Gloss gate on the 840 known-answer items: balanced accuracy ≥ 0.90, per class reported.
  - Then gloss the MAPPED rows → CORRECT / ERROR / UNRESOLVED, and seal.
  - A Sonnet-5 audit only on a 120-row stratified sample.
  - Out-of-family faithful forms (13% of ERROR_CERT) are carried as a label-noise bound; the AUROC is reported with and without those template classes.
  - Testable only if ≥ 50 CORRECT rows; power is adequate at ≥ 200. The judge scores for FREE rows already exist from iter 3.

  P2. E2 drift gate FIRST (~$0.3). Replay the full track-H set (192 judgements) with pinned model ids.
  - PASS (flag rate on original errors within the CI of E's 0.84): E's frozen solver + panel protocol labels E2.
  - FAIL: E2-L25/EXC labels are reported as DRIFTED (secondary), and the primary confirmation becomes R_COMP FREE plus E2-DT. DT is labelled by the alignment-free exhaustive-map + gloss labeller against the trusted prover-built gold.

  P3. E2 generation for all 550 sentences (10 slots). Then the panel in the order L25 → EXC → DT, then the L25 surplus (98) if budget remains.
  - The LONG POOL (L25 + EXC) is PRE-DECLARED PRIMARY, and its MDE (~0.11-0.12) is stated in advance.
  - The 30 pilot sentences are included (sealed; never read by a selection step), and results are reported with and without them.

  P4. Judges on E2: flash-lite disguised and original, and nano, on every parseable row (~$0.5). Also a local Qwen3-8B judge, L2-bow and the local round trip for S4_E2, which is cross-fitted by E2 sentence folds.

  P5. The GG dev screen (gloss calls only on pairs where exact/ALIGN fail but a map exists; <$0.5).

  P6. Frontier gemini-3.1-pro on a 300-row stratified E2 subsample (~$1.1). This is the first thing dropped if budget binds.

  DROPPED:
  - all remaining CSC arms (PERTURB G3-P/G4/MT, OTHER-SIG, multi-reading);
  - any new dataset construction beyond E2;
  - the SIG regime as evidence for the user's operating condition.

  ========================================================================
  4. SUCCESS CRITERIA (fixed now)
  ========================================================================

  CONFIRM (the lead becomes a finding):
  - (a) E2 long pool: frozen c_score_align − flash-lite disguised strat CI > 0 AND point > 0 vs flash-lite original and nano.
  - (b) E2 nested [S4_E2 + c] − S4_E2 strat CI > 0.
  - (c) R_COMP FREE untouched (if testable): within-template c_score_align − flash-lite, disguised AND original, CI > 0. This is the first in-scope, free-vocabulary, trusted-reference test on long conditioned sentences.

  PARTIAL:
  - (a) holds, (c) is untestable or n.s.: confirmed on real long sentences, free-vocabulary templated text unresolved.
  - (c) holds, (a) is n.s. with point ≥ +0.05: 'underpowered on E2, confirmed on R_COMP FREE'.

  DISCONFIRM: the (a) point ≤ 0 on the E2 long pool. The E result was development-set optimism, and the judge/stack is the incumbent. This is reported plainly.

  Also reported, not gating:
  - L25 alone (expected MDE 0.11; the point estimate is stated with its power);
  - DT sign (domain transfer);
  - frontier ratio and nested gain on the 300-row subsample;
  - system-level τ-b over 13 system × variant rows;
  - rename FA and paired flip for c_score_align on E2 CORRECT rows under RENAME_SYN and RENAME_NONCE;
  - coverage with unparseables in the denominator;
  - $ and seconds per candidate, FULL vs MARGINAL.

  H-MECH is scored CONFIRMED or REFUTED per item (i)-(iv).

  H-IMPROVE: the carried variant − V0 on the E2 long pool, strat CI > 0 → CONFIRMED improvement; otherwise V0 stands and the variant is reported as a development-only result.

  H-RENAME: CONFIRMED only if GG passed the dev gate AND on E2 CORRECT rows its RENAME_SYN paired flip is ≤ 0.05 while its E2 long-pool AUROC is ≥ c_score_align − 0.01.

  ERROR TYPE (the user's 'which kind of error'):
  - The answer is NEGATIVE outside a shared vocabulary: free3 0.123 on E; medoid 0.328 vs judge 0.326.
  - Within a shared vocabulary, typed repair reaches 0.784 (SIGPROXY), but that regime is out of scope.
  - No new budget.

  ========================================================================
  5. PAPER OBLIGATIONS (all transcription; blocking review items)
  ========================================================================
  - Apply eval-3 Part 4 in place. Each corrected item gets a '[Correction, iter 4: …; source <path>]' marker next to the struck original text:
    - §3.4 from perturb_corrected.csv: MEANING_RENAME = an ERROR operator; per-operator consensus AUROC = base endorsement; the judge cells from perturb_sensitivity.csv; coverage 3,419/5,402;
    - §3.3 from t2_record.csv: T2 NOT CONFIRMED, and the FREE deltas are void;
    - §3.5 with the pre-registered M1-M4, NET +0.356, and cost_units.csv;
    - the iter-1/2 items in corrections_iter12.csv: frontier C4 'strengthens'; the 588 common items; 'fitted under solver labels'.
  - Replace the placeholder artifact IDs from artifact_id_map.csv.
  - Add the following sections and tables:
    - '3.7 Hypothesis verdicts';
    - 'Prior-art positioning [ARTIFACT:art_VIF75I5R6f0v]': scoop rule, neighbour table, C1-C5 verdicts;
    - the coverage-against-request table, with one-line answers: long sentences → pending E2; no controlled vocabulary → pending R_COMP FREE; error type → negative;
    - the function inventory;
    - ONE cost table with units;
    - the iteration-4 spend table (§0.3F);
    - a reasoning block at the start of §3 and §4 (previous review score and blocking status, move, prediction, gates, planned vs actual artifacts).
  - Rewrite §4.2-4.6 from §0.3A-E exactly, with CIs copied verbatim. 'CSC is a dead end' becomes 'provisional negative on a completion-selected subset; L25 and RENAME untested'.
  - Extend the dead-ends table:
    - rename-invariant selection (NF/HYB INELIGIBLE);
    - candidate B1 (never ran);
    - the FOL-Triage rewrite-FA gate;
    - P2 and P4 REFUTED;
    - CSC_graded, CSC_multi and HYB_MEAN (all fail G1);
    - E2 EXC-core supply;
    - correct the c_nf reason to 'selection failure + MEANING_RENAME blindness'.
  - 'What we have learned' must drop '0.954 on R_COMP' and '96% of frontier' as headlines, or caveat them (out-of-scope SIG; point estimate only). It must state the long-tercile k95 = 5.

  ========================================================================
  6. CARRIED AS SECONDARY ROWS; CLOSED
  ========================================================================
  Secondary rows: PT, TEXT (L2-bow + L3), NF/HYB, graded consensus, S4 stacks, round trip, SC-5, pilot structural metrics, the local judges.

  CLOSED, one sentence each in the paper:
  - CSC and all its arms;
  - post-hoc NF/HYB as a rename fix;
  - the panel route for R_COMP FREE;
  - per-operator within-base AUROC for consensus;
  - B1/B2; R_ADJ; L1 lint and L2-role on LLM outputs;
  - the vocabulary-divergence diagnosis of iteration 3 (refuted on E by the label-based decomposition).

  DELIVERABLE FUNCTIONS:
  - consensus_score(mode = align | exact | nf | hyb | pn | rw | gg);
  - graded_consensus;
  - pairwise_matrix / ed_decomposition;
  - exhaustive_map_label + gloss_decision (the labelling tools);
  - equivalent_modulo_vocab(_exhaustive);
  - minimal_typed_repair;
  - fol_triage;
  - peer_text.
  Each has a one-line statement of what it measures, and each is marked gold-free or gold-using.
motivation: >-
  The user needs to score (text, FOL) pairs with no gold, and has warned that detecting synthetic perturbations is not the
  target. Two in-step facts reshape the design. (1) Real errors are not where perturbation suites look. After vocabulary alignment,
  polarity-type single edits are about 10% of repairable real errors, while a uniform typed suite (our iteration-2 suite:
  3 of 10 operators) spends 30% of its mass on them. Nearly half of real errors are multi-edit restructurings. Coverage (a
  missing condition, an added property) dominates the rest. (2) Real errors split by what is needed to SEE them. About a quarter
  are visible from the formula alone, as shapes almost no English sentence has (∃x(A→B), glued independent claims, a restrictor
  inside ↔, free variables). Those can be flagged with near-zero false alarms, no text, no LLM and no gold, and the check
  cannot be contaminated. The rest need the text, and a bag-of-words check is too weak for them, so role-level accounting
  or a text-only questionnaire is required. This gives the user three things. First, a cheap, deterministic L1 layer that
  flags a known share of errors with a known false-alarm rate, and that also audits gold: it found an error in the curated
  corrected gold. Second, a principled place to spend small-LLM money (L3), only where L1/L2 are blind. Third, a validation
  recipe (census-reweighted typed perturbations) that says when a cheap synthetic test suite can stand in for real labelled
  errors. That matters because gold is rare and partly wrong (about 36-39% of original FOLIO/MALLS gold, per 2606.02837).
  The long, heavily conditioned stratum the user cares about is now labelable. MALLS-train holds 1,501 sentences of at least
  25 words with 3 or more conditions, and 986 exception-bearing sentences of at least 15 words, which replaces the infeasible
  SARA Prolog. That is where the pilot shows both the biggest risk (L1 false alarms rise at 20 words or more) and the biggest
  opportunity: in the pilot census the COMPOUND share of errors rises from 7/27 (26%) under 12 words to 14/24 (58%) at 20
  words or more, exactly the mass that single-invariant checks and typed perturbations miss.
assumptions:
- >-
  Corrected gold anchors real-error labels well enough once it is itself audited. The pilot shows that the curated gold contains
  residual errors: L1 flagged the corrected vaccine formula ∃x(A→B). Automatic vocabulary alignment over-accepts meaning-changing
  renames: 21/99 is an upper bound, and bag-of-words L2 fires on 4 of those 21. So every VOCAB/GRAN and COMPOUND pair, plus
  a 20% sample of the rest, goes to a 3-family adjudication panel on disguised items. The panel's own accuracy is measured
  first on typed perturbations, split by DOWN and UP position. Curator AMBIGUITY flags define a separate 'reading choice'
  label class that is never pooled with errors.
- >-
  Formula smells mined from annotator errors transfer to LLM errors, at least partly. This is the main risk to C1(a). It is
  tested directly: L1 false alarms are measured per family on verified-correct LLM outputs (equivalent to corrected gold modulo
  alignment, or panel-confirmed), and L1 precision on real LLM errors. If a smell exceeds 3% false alarms for any family it
  is dropped, and that is reported, not tuned.
- >-
  A small LLM that reads only the sentence can fill a fixed role schema (condition vs assertion, force, negation, claim grouping,
  argument order) with ≥ 85% per-field accuracy. This is measured on the gold-derived schema answers of verified items before
  L3 is fused. Because L3 never sees a formula, it cannot copy a memorised gold formula. Contamination is still checked by
  comparing original items with disguised items (entities and predicates renamed).
- >-
  Enough labelled long items exist. MALLS-train gives 1,501 items with at least 25 words and 3 conditions, and 4,539 with
  at least 20 words and 3 conditions (probes/complexity_counts.out.txt). Its GPT-4 gold is noisy, so a stratified 600 are
  relabelled by the panel. FOLIO-refined (19 such premises) and ProverQA-hard (0 long conditioned sentences among 8,948) cannot
  fill this stratum. A stratum is tested only if it holds at least 50 errors AND at least 50 correct outputs.
- >-
  The z3 fragment covers the data. 8 of 302 curated corrected formulas fail our parser, and 334 of 27,284 MALLS-train formulas
  fail. Every unparseable output is counted in the denominator as a coverage failure. Timeouts are labelled UNKNOWN and never
  merged with proofs.
investigation_approach: >-
  COMPONENT MAP (layer: target error types; pilot reach on real human errors; calibration status). L1 lint: GLUE/UNGLUE, RESTR,
  BIND/free variable, ∃→ and ↔-restrictor structure, well-formedness; 47% of structural/polarity-type, 28% of compound, 12%
  of coverage errors; 1.7% false alarms on gold, still to be calibrated per LLM family. L2 accounting: ADD/DROP coverage,
  constants, predicate substitution; bag-of-words form 32% of coverage errors at 8.5% false alarms (paired AUROC 0.58); role-aware
  form not yet probed. L2 polarity/slot rules: NEG/REV/QUANT/SWAP; iteration-2 anchor 0.86-0.88 on synthetic REV/∀→∃, but
  polarity-type is only 10% of real repaired errors. L3 questionnaire: conditions vs assertions, claim grouping, force and
  order, aimed at COMPOUND and coverage; not yet probed, gated on ≥ 85% per-field accuracy. ARTIFACT PLAN (each executor has
  ≤ $10 of OpenRouter spend, tracked after every call; costs are estimated before each sweep). STEP 0, PRE-REGISTRATION: freeze
  the smell list, the L2 rules, the L3 schema, the thresholds, the splits, the strata and the analyses before any LLM-output
  label is seen. Go/no-go gate per component: ≤ 10% false alarms on verified-correct outputs in every length stratum, otherwise
  the component is dropped and the drop is reported. STEP 1, META-EVALUATION SET (dataset artifact, ≈ $8). (a) HUMAN TRACK:
  the curated FOLIO-validation conclusions and MALLS-test subset (302 items; 99 non-equivalent original→corrected pairs),
  plus a natural SPECIFICITY set: sentences shared between yfxiao/folio-refined and the DSAVlab-corrected FOLIO, i.e. two
  independent 'correct' annotations, whose non-equivalent pairs must classify as VOCAB/GRAN/CONVENTION or as a residual gold
  error confirmed by the panel. (b) LLM TRACK: about 1,500 sentences stratified by complexity (FOLIO-refined sentences, MALLS-test,
  and a stratified 600 from MALLS-train, oversampling those with at least 20 words, 3 or more conditions or exception markers).
  Candidates come from at least 8 distinct model families on OpenRouter, from small to frontier, each zero- and few-shot,
  plus ccg2lambda (kenken6696/folio_by_ccg2lambda) and the Logic-LM released FOLIO outputs. (c) SEMI-SYNTHETIC COMPOSED items:
  2-4 verified short gold rules nested under 'unless / provided that / except where' templates, with gold derived under both
  weak and strong exception readings. They form a separate stratum and are never pooled with real-error AUROC. (d) TYPED PERTURBATIONS
  of verified gold with the same 12 operators as the census, at matched DOWN/UP positions. (e) MEANING-PRESERVING REWRITES:
  STRICT (renaming, reordering, De Morgan, prenex, contrapositive) and CONVENTION (⊕/∨, weak/strong exception, →/↔ for 'means',
  added sortal restrictor, lexical negation). STEP 2, LABELS AND THEIR BIAS: z3 equivalence to corrected gold → equivalence
  modulo vocabulary (aligner, merge/split and arity-reification bridges) → minimal typed repair (depth ≤ 2, fingerprint-prefiltered,
  z3-verified; code in probes/repair_census.py) → panel adjudication of VOCAB/GRAN/COMPOUND plus a 20% sample. Report precision
  and recall of the automatic vocabulary classifier against the panel, the gold-error rate (including residual errors in corrected
  gold, L1-assisted), the correct-but-not-equivalent rate, the reading-choice rate, and every AUROC under naive, vocabulary-corrected
  and adjudicated labels. STEP 3, CENSUS (C2): minimal-typed-repair classes for human and LLM errors, per family and per complexity
  stratum, with bootstrap CIs. Include a χ² test against the uniform mix of standard perturbation suites and against each
  other. Specificity control: the same classifier on panel-confirmed correct-but-non-equivalent pairs; report error-vs-correct
  contrasts, not raw shares. STEP 4, REUSABLE FUNCTIONS (experiment artifact), each with a precise docstring: fol_lint(fol)
  → smell codes; content_accounting(text, fol); role_accounting(text, fol) (UD roles with generic-subject repair, DOWN-anchor
  polarity, slot order); formula_role_profile(fol) (solver-exact schema answers); role_questionnaire(text) (small LLM, text
  only; cost of about $0.0003 per item); fol_triage(text, fol) → {p_error, fired_layer, codes, coverage_status}; equivalent_modulo_vocab(a,
  b) and minimal_typed_repair(cand, ref), which are the labelling tools released with the dataset. STEP 5, BASELINES: parse
  rate; the pilot's structural metrics (joint-load conflicts, arity consistency, undefined predicates, rerun Jaccard); round-trip
  (a cheap LLM verbalises, then NLI and embedding similarity to the source, plus re-formalise-and-z3-equivalence); a cheap
  LLM judge on all items and a strong judge on a 300-item stratified subsample; K=5 sampling self-consistency modulo vocabulary;
  and a DECOMPOSED judge that sees the formula and is asked the L3 questions, which isolates what solver-exact answering adds.
  STEP 6, ANALYSES (evaluation artifact). Item level: AUROC, AUPRC and precision at the pre-registered threshold. Incremental
  value: nested logistic models with bootstrap ΔAUROC over the best baseline combination, plus partial correlations. System
  level: Kendall τ over families (prompt variants averaged) with a CI, reported descriptively, and over all variants. Per-error-type
  sensitivity by census class. Invariance: false alarms per rewrite family. Coverage, with every failure in the denominator.
  Cost in $ and seconds per item. Complexity: AUROC and false alarms against length, quantifier count, nesting depth, number
  of conditions and number of exceptions. A competing-effects test asks whether the cascade's slope is less negative than
  the judge's. Contamination: judge and round-trip accuracy on original vs disguised items. C3 decomposition: for each non-degenerate
  metric, MIX, WITHIN-TYPE and NOISE terms with paired bootstrap CIs; no τ-across-metrics test. Power: with about 300 errors
  and 300 correct outputs per pooled comparison, the AUROC SE is about 0.02 and the minimum detectable paired ΔAUROC is about
  0.05. Per stratum (≥ 50/50), the MDE is about 0.10; strata below that are declared untestable in advance.
success_criteria: >-
  C1 CONFIRM: (a) L1 precision ≥ 0.8 on real LLM errors, with false alarms ≤ 3% on verified-correct outputs of every model
  family for sentences under 20 words, and a reported, length-conditional false-alarm rate at 20 words or more. (b) The fused
  cascade's ΔAUROC over the best baseline combination has a 95% CI > 0 on adjudicated labels. (c) The cascade reaches AUROC
  ≥ 0.9 × the strong judge's at ≤ 5% of its cost, or beats it in the top complexity stratum. C1 PARTIAL: L1+L2 alone give
  a pre-filter with precision ≥ 0.8 that covers ≥ 25% of real LLM errors (the pilot on human errors shows 27% for L1 at 1.7%
  false alarms), but no ΔAUROC over the judge. This ships as a free first pass, with the remaining error mass stated. C1 DISCONFIRM:
  L1 precision < 0.6 on LLM outputs (the smells do not transfer from annotators to LLMs), AND the ΔAUROC CI includes 0 in
  every stratum. This is reported as a clear negative for structure-only gold-free checks, and the per-layer oracle-vs-deployable
  gap shows whether the checks or the text instruments failed. C2 CONFIRM: on LLM outputs, polarity-type operators ≤ 20% of
  repaired errors (CI upper bound < 0.25), coverage operators ≥ 40%, and the mix differs from uniform (χ² p < 0.01). The classifier
  labels ≥ 80% of panel-confirmed correct-but-non-equivalent pairs as non-errors (specificity control). Human-vs-LLM mix differences
  are reported either way. C2 DISCONFIRM: polarity-type ≥ 35% on LLM outputs, meaning LLMs err differently from annotators.
  This reverses the design priority back toward polarity anchors, and is reported as such. C3 CONFIRM (MIX-dominant): for
  ≥ 2/3 of non-degenerate non-LLM metrics, census-reweighted synthetic sensitivity is within ±0.10 of real sensitivity on
  clean labels. The result, 'typed perturbations are a valid proxy once reweighted by a real-error census', is actionable.
  C3 ALTERNATIVE: the reweighted prediction misses by more than 0.10. Per-operator WITHIN-TYPE ratios are then reported as
  the finding, e.g. that real DROPs remove the least salient condition. In every outcome the label-noise term is reported
  separately, so no gap is attributed to metrics that noise alone explains.

  or agreement. They are baselines here, and part of the C3 decomposition.

  Brunello et al. AAAI 2026 (arXiv 2511.11816, same group as 2606.02837) and FOL closeness-metric sensitivity (arXiv 2501.08613).
  They run perturbation studies of GOLD-based metrics. C3 asks whether such perturbation sensitivity predicts real-error sensitivity,
  for gold-free metrics.

  The Signal-Coverage Matrix (arXiv 2606.28013, Lean 4) crosses type-checking with gold-free semantic judges (an Opus judge
  and GTED) on real outputs. Closest in spirit for real-error evaluation, but for Lean statements, without a repair census
  or a text-free layer, and with the judges calibrated against each other rather than against adjudicated labels.
- >-
  SyGNS (Yanaka et al. 2021) and Udep2Mono (Chen & Gao 2021). SyGNS is gold-based polarity comparison, which is our oracle
  polarity. Udep2Mono is the text-side polarity marker. We showed in iteration 2 that Udep2Mono conflicts with FOL restrictor
  conventions, and we repaired that; polarity now serves as one L2 rule.
inspiration: >-
  Three imports, each chosen because it directly fixes a measured failure. (1) SOFTWARE STATIC ANALYSIS: linters flag code
  that is almost never intended, without knowing the spec. Bug patterns are mined from real fixes (FindBugs, Getafix, wild-caught
  mutants). Applied to logic, some formulas are almost never what English means, so they can be flagged without reading the
  text. The pilot: 27% of real errors, 1.7% false alarms. (2) CLINICAL SCREENING CASCADES: a cheap, high-specificity test
  runs first, and costlier tests run only where the cheap one is blind, each with its false-positive rate fixed on known negatives.
  That fixes the compounding false alarms of iteration 1 and spends LLM money only on the error mass L1/L2 cannot see. (3)
  SUMMARIZATION FACTUALITY and MUTATION-TESTING methodology: census real errors first, then weight synthetic tests by that
  census (FRANK; Just et al.). In FOL this becomes testable exactly, because the minimal repair between a candidate and a
  reference can be SEARCHED and PROVED with a solver instead of annotated by hand.
terms:
- term: FOL-Triage
  definition: >-
    The proposed gold-free metric: L1 formula lint (no text), L2 text accounting (no LLM), L3 text-only role questionnaire
    (small LLM) compared with solver-exact formula answers. The three are fused into P(unfaithful), with the firing layer
    and an error code.
- term: Formula smell (lint rule)
  definition: >-
    A deterministic formula-only pattern that almost no English sentence means, e.g. ∃x(A→B), ∀x(A∧B), a restrictor inside
    ↔, glued independent claims, a free variable, an arity clash, a vacuous predicate, or a valid/unsatisfiable formula.
- term: Minimal typed repair
  definition: >-
    The smallest set of typed edits (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE) that makes
    a candidate provably equivalent (z3) to the corrected gold after vocabulary alignment. More than 2 edits, or no repair
    found, is COMPOUND. It defines the error type of a real error.
- term: Vocabulary alignment
  definition: >-
    Renaming candidate predicates and constants onto reference ones (same arity, token/character similarity), plus merge/split
    and arity-reification bridges. Equivalence after alignment means VOCAB/GRAN, i.e. not an error. It is an upper bound,
    because meaning-changing renames also align, so it is adjudicated.
- term: Reading choice
  definition: >-
    A correction on a sentence the curators flagged ambiguous, where the gold picks one legitimate reading. It is a separate
    label class, not an error.
- term: Transfer decomposition (MIX / WITHIN-TYPE / NOISE)
  definition: >-
    A metric's synthetic-minus-real sensitivity is split into three parts. MIX: per-type synthetic sensitivity reweighted
    by the real census. WITHIN-TYPE: the same operator, synthetic vs real. NOISE: naive vs adjudicated labels.
- term: Solver-exact answerer
  definition: >-
    z3 queries that read role facts off a formula exactly: per-predicate monotonicity (DOWN = condition, UP = asserted), quantifier
    force per claim block, connectivity components (independent claims) and argument slots.
- term: Correct-but-not-equivalent
  definition: >-
    A faithful candidate that is not logically equivalent to gold because of vocabulary, granularity or a legitimate convention.
    It is estimated by alignment plus panel adjudication.
summary: >-
  FOL-Triage is a three-layer gold-free faithfulness check for NL→FOL: a text-free formula lint, LLM-free text accounting
  and a text-only small-LLM role questionnaire answered exactly by a solver on the formula side. In-step, the lint alone flagged
  27% of real annotator errors at 1.7% false alarms, and found an error in curated gold. The hypothesis also covers a minimal-typed-repair
  census of real errors (coverage dominates; polarity is about 10%; 46% compound) and a MIX/WITHIN-TYPE/NOISE decomposition
  of why synthetic perturbation tests overstate metric quality.
alternates:
- title: Text judges truth in solver-built worlds
  hypothesis: >-
    z3 builds small models that separate the candidate from its own typed single-edit mutants (the census operators). Each
    model is verbalised by template, and a small NLI model judges whether that situation is consistent with the text. The
    mismatch rate predicts real errors, including COMPOUND ones, with no gold and no large LLM.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    46% of real errors are compound restructurings that no role field isolates. A truth-value judgement on concrete situations
    sees any behavioural difference through one mechanism. It beats FOL-Triage if the small NLI model judges templated worlds
    with at least about 85% accuracy on long conditioned sentences.
- title: Agreement across systems by repair distance
  hypothesis: >-
    For each sentence, several diverse systems' outputs are aligned modulo vocabulary. A candidate's minimal-typed-repair
    distance to the cross-system medoid (0 = equivalent, 1-2 = typed edit, 3+ = compound) is its error score, and the repair
    operators give the error type.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It needs no text-side instrument at all, which removes the weakest link (L2 bag-of-words AUROC was 0.59). It wins if errors
    are idiosyncratic across model families. It loses where families share a blind spot or a reading choice, which the census
    measures.
- title: Template verbalisation plus bidirectional entailment
  hypothesis: >-
    A deterministic, non-repairing FOL→English template verbaliser, plus a small NLI model checking entailment in both directions
    against the source, predicts faithfulness. Missing content fails text→formula entailment, and added content fails formula→text
    entailment.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    Coverage operators are 57% of repairable real errors, and bag-of-words accounting is weak on them. If NLI handles templated
    logical English, it captures coverage in context, which bag-of-words matching cannot, without any alignment step.
- title: A disguised cheap judge is enough
  hypothesis: >-
    A cheap LLM judge, shown the sentence and the formula with every predicate and constant renamed to neutral tokens (so
    memorised gold cannot help), matches the strong judge. Neither the lint nor the questionnaire adds signal over it.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If current small LLMs already recognise ∃x(A→B)-style shapes and dropped conditions, structure adds nothing and the cheapest
    reliable metric is the judge. C1(b)'s ΔAUROC test decides between them directly.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same consensus object; CSC closed; cause re-diagnosed as wrong peers; broken confirmation sets fixed once
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  The CSC fix is CLOSED as a provisional negative. On a completion-selected 354-row subset, c_csc strat is 0.614 [0.493, 0.736]
  vs FREE_exact 0.770, Δ −0.156 [−0.290, −0.031]; anchoring e is 0.459 vs 0.173. G1 FAIL, G2 NOT_READ, G3 NOT_RUN. The title
  changes because the candidate's-own-words idea is dead.
- >-
  The diagnosis is revised from label-based evidence (eval 3). 61-77% of the disagreement a CORRECT candidate meets comes
  from peers labelled ERROR; only 9% of correct-correct disagreement is vocabulary. Every vocabulary bridge trades d for e:
  the aligner's meaning-rename e is 0.624 vs 0.104 for exact. The iter-3 'words not errors' story is refuted on E.
- >-
  Iteration 5 is confirmation-first. The two budget-broken confirmation sets are each fixed ONCE, with claims unchanged: the
  R_COMP FREE gloss labels (priority 1, in-scope free vocabulary) and E2 (long pool pre-declared primary, MDE ~0.11 stated).
  Frozen c_score_align is the pre-declared primary and is not re-selected.
- >-
  A drift gate comes before E2 labelling, because today's panel flags 0.12 vs 0.84 of original errors on 22 track-H items.
  On failure, the primary switches to R_COMP FREE + DT, labelled by the alignment-free map + gloss labeller against trusted
  gold.
- >-
  New $0 development screen aimed at the re-diagnosed cause (wrong, scattered peers): plurality-normalised, reliability-weighted
  and two-channel exact/align consensus. The selection rule is pre-registered; the winner is only a candidate for E2.
- >-
  The last rename attempt uses a new mechanism: gloss-gated name-free agreement. The lexical check separates synonyms from
  wrong predicates, which NF/HYB could not, and no cueing means no anchoring. It is dev-gated on PERTURB; on failure, rename
  non-invariance is reported as a measured boundary.
- >-
  The iteration-4 record is corrected for the paper: CIs copied verbatim from T4/T5, COMPOUND e 0.282/0.107, G2 NOT_READ,
  M3 under both specifications, NET within-arm, FREE consensus recall paired with base FA 0.71-0.99, LOCAL2 ties, typing free3
  0.123 on E (oracle is gold-using), E2 drift, FREE labels 'up to 70.7%', eval-3 misreadings removed ('0.683 theoretical AUROC'),
  and spend ≈$0.35 with the rest of the $7 phase budget unaccounted.
- >-
  Every blocking review item is listed as a paper transcription obligation: in-place corrections from eval-3 Part 4, the prior-art
  section for art_VIF75I5R6f0v, coverage-vs-request, one cost table with units, the spend table, the extended dead-ends table,
  and reasoning blocks.
- >-
  The error-type ask is answered negatively outside a shared vocabulary (free3 0.123; medoid 0.328 ≈ judge 0.326). No further
  budget goes to it.
_evidence_state: lead
_move: deepen
_move_rationale: >-
  Lead (consensus + eval-3 cause). Deepen: confirm frozen consensus on untouched E2/R_COMP FREE (fix each once), attack wrong-peer
  cause at $0; CSC closed.
_coverage: full
_coverage_statement: >-
  Iteration 5 answers whether a cheap gold-free cross-model agreement score predicts faithfulness on long, conditioned sentences
  with no controlled vocabulary. It tests this on untouched data against judges and the baseline stack, and also reports invariance,
  per-type recall, coverage and cost, plus a negative answer on error typing.

  (gpt-4.1-nano T=0.7 on all items; true same-model gpt-3.5-turbo SC for gpt-3.5 candidates), predicate-set stability, and

  MALLS-train L25=300 (>=25 words, >=3 conditions; includes a pre-registered 100-sentence top-up), L20=150, EXC=100 (unless/except/without),

  output=CORRECT/ERROR/CONTESTED/UNRESOLVED/UNPARSEABLE. Labels combine the shared z3 solver labeller with a blind, nonce-disguised,
  family-disjoint panel (Haiku-4.5/GLM-4.6/Kimi-K2; Haiku adjudicates only GLM/Kimi disagreements). The combination rule gives
  tier A (solver), B (panel-decided VOCAB_GRAN/COMPOUND) and C (no trusted reference). Metadata per row: sentence_id (bootstrap
  cluster), item_id, strata {words,n_quant,depth,n_conditions,exception_type,source_stratum,l25_topup_batch}, auto_label,
  repair_ops, panel_votes, error_ops, label_tier, reference_status, correct_not_equivalent, reading_choice, disguised_text/fol.
  Tier A+B testable: L25 176 CORRECT/697 ERROR; L20, EXC and CTRL are also testable. (2) heldout_sentences: 700 rows with
  reference status (GOLD_PANEL_OK 95, PANEL_REPAIRED 145, NO_TRUSTED_REFERENCE 295, TRUSTED_AGREED 36, DISPUTED 112). (3)

  Logic-LM track-L and curated track-H rows keyed by the screen's item_id; also in screen_adjudicated_labels.json. Caveats:
  the panel is STRICT. Its majority accuracy on real errors is 0.727, and it accepts only 0.61 of expert-corrected formulas.
  It rejected 82% of MALLS gold, so ERROR is over-called: confirm on tier A too. HELD-OUT: iteration 2 must not tune thresholds
  on it. Primary analysis = tiers A+B excluding CONTESTED and reading_choice, bootstrapped by sentence_id. See dataset_card.md.

  (metadata_fold PERTURB, output ERROR, error_ops=[op]) plus 868 meaning-preserving controls (PERTURB_CONTROL, output CORRECT).
  They cover 300 bases: 36 TRUSTED_AGREED + 95 GOLD_PANEL_OK + 69 PANEL_REPAIRED dataset-E references, and 100 R_COMP weak
  readings. Operators are NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD (ADD_FOREIGN / ADD_INTERNAL), SWAP, BIND and MEANING_RENAME,
  at DOWN/UP positions (metadata_position_polarity, polarity_method, matched_pair_id; 1,354 complete pairs). QUANT/REV/RESTR
  are UP-only; SCOPE and UNGLUE have 0 rows. Each mutant is z3 non-equivalent to every accepted reading. Controls are RENAME_SYN
  / RENAME_NONCE, REORDER and CONTRAPOSITIVE/DEMORGAN, each z3-equivalent. (2) R_COMP (group rcomp_sentences): 250 main +
  100 reserve templated sentences, each with >=25 words, >=3 conditions and one unless/except/provided-that/only-if clause
  (9 templates). Weak and strong references come from the template (T8 also stores a not-accepted converse), are unit-tested
  and z3-checked, and are built from a 652-entry atom lexicon mined from verified FOLIO/MALLS references. Provenance fields:
  template_id, lexicon_ids, source_rule_ids. CAVEAT: the shared OpenRouter key hit its daily limit 5 minutes in ($0.41 spent);
  the 21:38 UTC replacement key was also already exhausted. Pending: the Sonnet lexicon and reference audits, fluency, generator
  candidates (rcomp_candidates), solver labels, adjudication and the testability declaration. ./run_all.sh completes them
  resumably under the pre-registered prereg_rcomp.json. Until then R_COMP must not be used for metric claims. PERTURB is ready
  for per-operator sensitivity and invariance analysis. Rows carry item_id (E's recipe) and disguised_text/fol. adjudicator_check_out.json
  holds 60 known-label QA items. See dataset_card.md.

title: Re-checking earlier logic-metric results across label sets
summary: >-
  Zero-LLM-spend, CPU-only re-analysis of the iteration-1 artifacts (exp A FOL-Triage, exp C consensus c_score, exp D judges/baselines,
  dataset E screen adjudication), joined on item_id. eval.py (+src/) writes eval_out.json (exp_eval_sol_out, validated; ~5.9k
  flat metrics_agg keys + structured metadata incl. VERDICT; 1,380 per-item examples with oriented scores, per-regime labels,
  PT OOF), tables/*.csv (each with a '# source:' line), figures/fig_regime_shift and fig_forest_common (json/png/pdf), and
  audit/ scripts. KEY FINDINGS. (1) Re-derivation gate: 57/57 reviewer audit numbers reproduce (n=389/160 err/151 sents; c_score
  .842, fused .767, judge_disg .785; tier A+B n=304 fused .872, bow .817, c_score .776, judge .771). (2) Same-item, same-label
  common sets for 13 regimes (testable: R_SOLVER_CONS n=373/155 err, own-label A/C/D, R_ADJ_AB 298/165, R_ADJ_ALL 498/271,
  CONTESTED->C/E, L_UNPARSEABLE_AS_ERROR 413/195; R_ADJ_A and all track-H regimes are untestable, reported sign-only). (3)
  The iteration-1 rule FAILS for fused_H and c_score in every regime (rewrite FA 0.275 / 0.96). fused_H minus judge is -0.013
  under solver labels but +0.096 [.020,.171] under A+B; c_score minus judge is +0.067 [-.012,.148] under solver labels and
  +0.006 under A+B. (4) Label-only shift solver->A+B on the same 161 items: bow +0.102 and fused +0.080 (CI>0) go up; c_score
  -0.106 goes down. Rank Kendall tau is 0.60. On the 58 flipped items, bow/fused flag 81-83% vs c_score 34% (instrument-sharing
  confirmed). (5) SCREEN PREVIEW: PT (cross-fitted c_score+bow_uncarried+l3) minus judge_cheap_disg is +0.089 [.010,.165]
  solver, +0.104 [.039,.175] A+B, +0.090 [.038,.142] all tiers, +0.118 unparseable-as-error. Nested S4+PT over refit S4 is
  +0.04-0.06 (CI>0). Screen bar that iteration-2 confirmation must beat = these deltas. (6) P1: the structural clause is untestable
  (all QUANT/SCOPE/BIND/SWAP/NEG cells have <15 errors); text beats peers on peer-endorsed errors (CI>0). P2a CONFIRMED only
  for all tiers. P2b depends on the comparator: vs c_score the gain comes from endorsed errors; vs bow it comes from non-endorsed
  errors. (7) At matched FA 0.10 the ORIGINAL cheap judge has higher recall than the disguised one (+0.11/+0.20). Contamination
  DiD CIs include 0 but MDE = 0.12-0.21, so a 0.05 effect is undetectable. Frontier minus cheap under A+B is +0.166. (8) Invariance
  comparisons across A/C/D used different rewrite sets. (9) Candidate B was planned but gen_art_experiment_2 is an empty .aii/
  dir: it never ran. (10) Exp C's -0.94/SD length interaction reproduces exactly. Exp A's L2-bow = n_unanch+uncarried (0.737)
  vs bow_uncarried (0.711). Panel expert-pair acceptance is .613 (unambiguous). Independent re-derivation (different code
  path) matches all headline numbers. On permuted labels the cross-fitted PT is biased below 0.5; the observed deltas exceed
  all 20 null deltas (null max .047 solver / .087 A+B).

title: Peer agreement vs paid AI judges on held-out logic
summary: >-
  T1 head-on test on held-out NL->FOL dataset E (8,507 real candidates, 700 sentences). The frozen peer-agreement consensus
  metric (c_score_align, exp 5) and PEER+TEXT fusion (p_peer_text) are compared with newly scored paid API comparators: gemini-2.5-flash-lite
  rubric-A JSON judge (disguised + original, every parseable row), gpt-4.1-nano P(YES) judge (both views), gemini-3.1-pro-preview
  frontier judge (original view, 284-row frame; disguised view blocked by the pre-registered shared-key reserve rule), API
  round trip (flash-lite verbaliser -> DeBERTa NLI/mpnet) and API SC-5 (nano, T=0.7, z3 modulo vocabulary); plus S4_full,
  a cross-fitted stack of all 28 baselines. Pre-registered in prereg_T1.json (sha256 c2a6cf84, frozen before any sweep score).
  Main population R_AB E_POOL PRIMARY n=2,686 (1,822 ERROR/864 CORRECT, 292 sentences); sentence-cluster bootstrap B=2000.

  (smaller length slope than the judge) DISCONFIRMED: +0.146 [-0.051,0.361]. Overall T1 (this artifact): CONFIRMED. Caveats:
  no advantage on the short FOLIO CTRL stratum (-0.069 [-0.23,0.10]) or on <12-word / <=1-condition sentences; the advantage
  concentrates in long, conditioned, exception sentences (EXC +0.197). Consensus misses aligner-masked MEANING_RENAME errors
  (recall 0.07 at FA 0.10 vs judges 0.13-0.20) and peer-endorsed errors (0.00). Flash-lite contamination DiD +0.105 [0.006,0.201]

  R_COMP (221 templated long rule sentences, >=25 words, >=3 conditions, one unless/except/provided-that/only-if clause; references
  trusted by construction) translated by 10 few-shot LLM slots (9 families) in two conditions. SIG (signature block given)
  is labelled by pure z3 equivalence to the weak or strong reading; FREE uses dataset 3's solver labels (tier A only: the
  dataset-E panel was not run because the shared key was exhausted, so FREE is NOT_TESTABLE and descriptive). PRIMARY (pre-registered,
  criterion c): within-template AUROC of c_score_sig (share of family-disjoint peers not z3-equivalent) vs the disguised gemini-2.5-flash-lite
  rubric-A judge on 1,904 SIG rows (395 ERROR / 1,509 CORRECT, 220 sentences): 0.954 vs 0.587, delta +0.367 [0.328, 0.404]
  (sentence-clustered, template-stratified bootstrap, B=2000) -> PASS. vs the original-text judge: +0.278 [0.239, 0.319].
  Nested [judge + c_sig] over [judge] +0.377; the judge adds ~0 over c_sig. Frontier gemini-3.1-pro on a 60-row subsample:
  c_sig 0.956 vs frontier orig 0.932 / disg 0.735; [frontier + c_sig] over frontier +0.088 [0.019, 0.172]. On R_COMP the disguise
  itself costs judges AUROC (cheap +0.085, local Qwen3-8B +0.175 orig - disg), because templated sentences cannot be memorised.
  Rename invariance: NF-anchored and HYB consensus are invariant (FA 0.26 = unrenamed), ALIGN and SIG-exact are not (FA 1.0
  on nonce renames). Mechanism: error endorsement e = 0; consensus false alarms are correct translations of the minority strong
  reading (flagged 96% vs 14% for weak). Complexity: no length slope for consensus (GEE). FREE tier A: c_align - judge +0.214
  [-0.034, 0.377], and consensus AUROC falls from 0.95 (SIG) to about 0.80, the vocabulary-divergence cost. Every headline
  number was re-derived from the raw files via an independent brute-force path (tests/rederive_raw.py, all match to 1e-9;
  placebos fail). Outputs: method_out.json (R_COMP_SIG, R_COMP_FREE; predict_* oriented higher = error), results/rcomp_candidates.jsonl
  (per-row labels, strata, z3 class ids, all scores), results/analysis.json, results/tables.md, results/deviations.json (15

  for the iteration-3 claim that cross-family solver consensus is a gold-free NL->FOL faithfulness metric. SCOOP RULE (multi-family
  translations + solver equivalence + faithfulness-label meta-eval on NL->FOL): no hit meets all three, so C1 is not scooped.
  Closest neighbours meet two of three each: ARc 2511.09008 (NL->SMT, k LLMs, per-translation confidence = share of k translations

  (csc_gate_E.json, PROVISIONAL): G1 FAIL, G2 FAIL (R_AB; L25 NOT_READ), G3-E NOT_RUN, G4 null, G5 PASS ($5.25e-4/candidate).
  Recommendation for iteration-5 rule: CSC not a fix; fall back to frozen c_score_align + p_peer_text. $0 FULL-population
  facts: matched free peers exact vs ALIGN d 0.583 vs 0.328; 53% of free-exact disagreements with CORRECT candidates are structural

title: Do symbol hints help model agreement checks?
summary: >-
  Iteration-4 T6-P experiment on Candidate-Signature Consensus (CSC): three peer families (deepseek-v3.2, phi-4, gpt-4.1-mini;
  +qwen3-235b for K4) are cued with the candidate's own symbol list, and agreement is exact case-insensitive z3 equivalence.
  DEVIATION D-BUDGET: the run-wide OpenRouter budget was exhausted by other artifacts before the first pilot call (403 aii_run_budget_exhausted;
  :free models also rate-limited), so NO CSC peer was generated. Gates G3-P (rename FA), G4 (anchoring) and MT (typing on
  E) are UNTESTED, not failed. The spend was $0.0000088. The full pipeline is built, unit-tested (73 tests pass) and resumable.
  The job list data/csc_jobs.jsonl holds 17,075 calls, projected at $3.07 using sibling-measured prices; run it with `method.py
  --stage pilot,peers,...`. Zero-cost arms, all labelled, frozen in prereg_csc_P.json before any join: (1) SIGPROXY: exp-7
  SIG outputs of the same four families, cued with the closed template signature, on 77 R_COMP bases. Recall on 1,196 mutants
  is 1.000 and recall given base endorsed is 1.000. On the same 74 long bases, correct-base FA d is 0.149 cued vs 0.757 uncued
  FREE3-ALIGN, a paired diff of -0.608 [-0.716, -0.500]. Rename FA is 1.000 under a base-signature cue, which shows renames
  need re-cueing. (2) SIG labelled check, k=3 family-matched: within-template AUROC 0.930 [0.916, 0.943] vs 9-peer c_score_sig
  0.952 and disguised flash-lite judge 0.587. (3) Same-vocabulary typed repair: ORACLE 0.928 on E (exp 8 oracle 0.802); SIGPROXY
  majority 0.784 [0.711, 0.849] on R_COMP; uncued FREE3 majority 0.123 on E (exp 8 baselines: medoid 0.328, judge 0.326).
  (4) Uncued d grows with length on E (c_align 0.47/0.80/0.91 by word tercile). (5) LOCAL2 is a secondary arm (qwen2.5-1.5b
  and gemma-2-2b, same CSC prompt, 27 E bases). Small peers use genuine listed symbols 0.81 and synonyms 0.70, but foreign,
  donor and nonce symbols only 0.11-0.16. Using a foreign or donor symbol never reproduced the mutant (0/25). Delta-anchor
  was 0 for ADD_FOREIGN and MEANING_RENAME; power is low (base endorsement 0.30). Independent re-derivation: tests/rederive.py
  makes 429 table checks with 0 mismatches; tests/rederive_headline.py recomputes the AUROC, the paired d, typing and the
  d terciles from raw files with failing placebos. Outputs: method_out.json (PERTURB_E_CSC 3,456, PERTURB_RCOMP_CSC 1,946,
  RCOMP_SIG_CSC 2,210; predict_* strings, higher = error; c_csc = NA), results/tables.md, anchoring.csv, controls_fa.csv,

title: Fresh logic test set, paused by budget
summary: >-
  E2 (PARTIAL, budget-stopped): the frozen, sealed design of a fresh NL->FOL faithfulness confirmation set disjoint from dataset
  E, labelled by E's byte-identical code (code_freeze.json). The run-level 'Test idea' OpenRouter budget ($7, shared by all
  concurrent artifacts) ran out at 07:26 UTC after this artifact spent $0.24. The proxy refuses paid calls until the user
  raises the budget. WHAT EXISTS: (1) 550 active sentences with gold references, pre-registered and hashed before generation
  (prereg_E2.json): L25 350 (MALLS-v0.1-train, >=25 words, >=3 conditions, 45% in the 30-34-word bin, mean 28.8 words / 4.65
  conditions); EXC 100; DT 100 (ProverQA dev, prover-built gold, 1 per entity skeleton, >=15 words and >=2 conditions). Also
  a ranked L25 surplus order (98) and a DT reserve (10). EXC CAVEAT: the core-exception supply is exhausted (E took all 67
  MALLS-train items; MALLS-test has 3, all excluded), so E2-EXC is 92 'without' + 8 non-XOR 'but not' items, core-marker share
  0.0. (2) A 30-sentence pilot (12 L25 / 8 EXC / 10 DT): 300 real candidates from E's 10 few-shot slots (9 families, temperature
  0) + 30 gold-as-system rows, solver-labelled by E's labeller. Without panel votes E's final rule gives 36 ERROR (tier A_unaudited_ref),
  244 UNRESOLVED, 20 UNPARSEABLE, 0 CORRECT. (3) A partial panel drift check: the 77 synthetic gate items were replayed with
  a fresh cache (majority agreement with E's stored votes 0.974; balanced accuracy P1 0.861 / P3 0.875 / R1 0.837 vs E 0.861
  / 0.85 / 0.863). Track H was cut off, so the stop rule is UNDECIDED. (4) A seal: candidates_E2_nolabels.jsonl vs sealed/labels_E2.jsonl
  + references, sha256 in seal.json, verify_seal.py passes. (5) testability_E2.json: NO cell is testable now. Projected MDE80
  if completed is 0.112 at L25=350 and 0.099 at 450; the direction's '400 L25 detect +0.08' claim is wrong (needs ~690). full_data_out.json
  groups: e2_candidates (300), e2_gold_as_system (30), e2_sentences (550, status PENDING_GENERATION_BUDGET_STOP for 520),
  e2_panel_drift (173). All source-checked rows verify. RESUME: `bash src_e2/run_all.sh` (resumable; projected $6.8, ~2.5
  h). DOWNSTREAM: in this state E2 cannot confirm any metric. Iteration 5 must either wait for the resume or use E2 only as
  a pipeline/seal smoke test. Deviations D0-D7 are in dataset_card.md.

  T8 (iteration 4) is a CPU-only evaluation: no LLM calls, $0. It never reads the sibling CSC experiment. Eval-2 functions
  are imported unchanged (code sha dd73975642f428cc). E and R_COMP are DEVELOPMENT data, so nothing here is confirmation.
  Gates all pass: G0 reproduces END_MAJ e 0.124 / d 0.537 and AUROC c_exact 0.748 / c_align 0.784; G1 pairs_E coverage 100%;
  G2 align concordance 99.97%; G3 recomputed R_COMP scores match exp 7 on 100% of rows. prereg_d_split.json was hashed before
  Part 1 ran. PART 1 (E, 2,672 scorable rows, 25,358 candidate-peer pairs). Pair classes (9-family): EXACT 13.6%, NAME_ONLY
  0.3%, ALIGN_ONLY 15.1%, VOCAB 1.6%, IRREDUCIBLE 69.4%. Matched 3-family pool (PRIMARY): d under END_MAJ 0.415; predicted
  d_floor (R_point_label, an oracle-assisted prediction) 0.402 [0.336, 0.471]; bracket [0.396, 0.415]; exact-only 0.683; no-anchoring
  oracle floor 0.385 (0.345 with a labelled denominator); e_ceiling 0.162. 9-family: 0.537 / 0.532 / 0.522, with oracle 0.586.
  The pre-registered gap_closed rule is ill-conditioned: its denominator is 0.013. Behind d, 77% (9-family) / 61% (3-pool)
  of non-agreeing peers of CORRECT candidates are labelled ERROR, and only 9% of CORRECT-CORRECT disagreements are NF/HYB-resolvable.
  The specificity placebo shows VOCAB agreements are not label-specific (ratio 1.98 [0.43, 11.4] 3-pool; 0.83 9-family). c_vres
  does not beat c_score_align on L25 (-0.014 [-0.028, -0.001]), which predicts that G2 fails. NET stays DEGRADES under every
  rule. PART 2 (R_COMP): SIG e 0.000, d 0.2596 (weak 0.143 / strong 0.965), SCATTER ratio 4.38. Paired same-slot-pair exact
  agreement is SIG 0.528 vs FREE 0.048, a drop of +0.479 [0.447, 0.513]. Post-hoc ALIGN recovers 41% of it, NF 18%, ALIGN∪NF
  45%. The out-of-sample validation of the Part-1 method FAILED: predicted 0.20 vs actual SIG endorsement 0.575, calibration
  error -0.37 [-0.42, -0.32]; Spearman across templates 0.97. So the instruments under-count vocabulary effects. PART 3 (power_E2.json):
  yield is L25 0.37, L20 0.53, EXC 0.64, CTRL 0.25. Planned L25 250/300/350/400 gives MDE80 0.130/0.119/0.110/0.103, all MARGINAL.
  Detecting +0.069 needs about 882 planned L25 sentences, or about 237 usable sentences in the long pool. R_COMP FREE needs
  at least 200 CORRECT rows. PART 4: 13 record tables (a)-(m) read by code with source lines; 64 claims, 60 match, 1 mismatch
  (the plan's $0.000996/candidate is a unit error: the source gives $0.000116 per candidate). The '26.8% of controls' figure
  holds for non-rename controls only. Audit: 11/11 independent re-derivations pass, and the placebos behave as expected. Outputs:
  eval_out.json (157 metrics; 2,672 E rows + 4,862 R_COMP rows), tables/*.csv, record.md, power_E2.json, pairwise_classes_RCOMP.jsonl,

  this artifact spent $2.05; key polled to the pre-registered 15:30 cutoff, never recovered. Done: drift gate PASS (panel
  majority agreement 0.955 on 269 items, providers pinned, M2 e2/E2_DRIFT_DECISION.json); all 5,500 candidates (550 sentences
  x 10 slots) generated; solver labels for all; panel labels only for the first sha1-order prefix of 110 sentences (37 L25/37
  EXC/36 DT; random prefix); every label-free score sealed before labels (V0, PT, c_exact, V1-V5, L2, L3, user's pilot metrics,

  0.510, dangling 0.413 (inverted); only 1-rerun-Jaccard 0.713 (a lexical cross-system agreement proxy). V0 is not rename-invariant:
  nonce-renamed correct formulas flagged 100% (n=145, base 0.26), synonym 94% (n=36). H-MECH: (i) 0.909 of peers disagreeing
  with CORRECT candidates are ERROR; (iv) ALIGN lowers false alarms 0.74->0.18 but endorses more rename-type errors; (ii)
  NOT_READ; (iii) CI includes 0. H-IMPROVE: V0 stands (freeze winner NONE); H-RENAME NOT CONFIRMED (GG failed dev gate). E2-B
  union adds no R_AB rows. Headline numbers independently re-derived (audit/rederive.py, sklearn from raw files, exact match;

  for confirming frozen cross-family consensus V0 = c_score_align against LLM judges. STATUS: PARTIAL, NOTHING CONFIRMATORY.
  The run-level OpenRouter budget ($12, shared by all concurrent artifacts) was exhausted at 11:39 UTC, after this artifact
  had spent $0.83; every later paid call returned HTTP 403, and probes until 14:41 all failed. WHAT EXISTS: (1) 400 sentences
  drawn by E2's frozen sha1 rule (E2 pool reproduced byte-exactly; 98 surplus + 302 continuation; 93.5% 25-29 words; 0 collisions
  with E/E2; reserve 150), with prereg_iter5_E2B.json frozen before generation. (2) 4,000 candidates from E2's 10 frozen generator
  slots (parse rate 0.883). (3) Solver labels for all 400 sentences with E2's byte-identical code (78 files hash-verified).
  The blind panel completed NO batch (the incomplete batch is excluded), so labels are E's final rule without votes: 48 CORRECT
  / 334 ERROR (tier A vs UNAUDITED MALLS gold), 3,151 UNRESOLVED, 467 UNPARSEABLE. R_AB has no CORRECT class; R_A_UNAUDITED
  misses E's testability floor (48 < 50), so B1-B4 and the union U1-U4 are NOT TESTABLE; E2-A's M3 never appeared. (4) Label-free
  scores, sealed before the join under a file-access guard: V0/PT via exp-5 code (reproduces stored E values 50/50), V1-V5
  (M1 winner NONE), flash-lite disguised on 2,735 rows in batch order; nano, flash-lite original, deepseek and the frontier
  run were refused (frontier 10-row pilot only). EXPLORATORY numbers (analysis/tables.md; not a faithfulness test, because
  CORRECT = z3-equivalent to an unaudited gold): V0 strat AUROC 0.737 [0.645, 0.827] vs flash-lite disguised 0.496; V0 - flash-lite
  +0.208 [0.066, 0.363] on 276 paired rows (31 CORRECT); nested [S4+V0]-S4 +0.120 [0.013, 0.237]. A label-coupling diagnostic
  shows about half of this gap is structural: with gold-equivalent peers removed, V0 falls to 0.611 and its lead to +0.133
  [-0.024, 0.314]. Label-free: cross-family agreement 13.4% of pairs; Spearman(V0, flash-lite) 0.296; rename paired flips
  0.088 (SYN) / 0.107 (NONCE), reverse flips 0, shuffled-peer placebo AUROC 0.50. V0 costs $0 marginal and 0.06 s of z3 per
  candidate. Every headline number was re-derived independently (analysis/rederive_headline.json); the permuted-label and
  random-score placebos fail as required. Everything is resumable: if budget returns, e2bsrc/src_e2b/run_batches_resume.sh,
  src/judge_resume.sh and src/finalize.sh complete the plan. src/union.py runs later with --e2a <E2-A per-row file>. See README.md,

  (results/score_seal_rcomp.json; prereg_rcomp_confirm.json git-committed 11:18:46Z). The dataset-5 labeller was resumed once:
  the gloss gate FAILED twice (gloss_v1 half A: Haiku BA 0.776, Qwen 0.855; the one revision gloss_v2 on held-out half B:
  Haiku 0.561 [0.861 on verdicted items, 141 NO_VERDICT], Qwen 0.883; neither checker passes alone), so FALLBACK B applies:
  all 1,506 MAPPED rows are UNRESOLVED_GLOSS_GATE_FAILED, 0 CORRECT, and criterion (c) = NOT_TESTABLE (final label seal b7916aea.../untouched
  79eb623a...). PROVISIONAL, NON-CONFIRMATORY (ERROR_CERT vs MAPPED, untouched, templated text): within-template AUROC c_score_align

  Iteration-5 FREEZE on dataset E (DEVELOPMENT data; nothing here confirms). PART A ($0): five label-free rescorings of frozen
  V0 = c_score_align, computed only from eval-2's pairwise eqmv matrix, sealed (sha256) before any label join. V1 plurality-normalised,
  V2 reliability-weighted (out-of-fold family weights), V3 = V1+V2, V4 cross-fitted exact/align logistic, V5 = V3 on the 3-pool.
  Gates reproduce exactly: G0 V0 strat 0.7415 and Δ +0.099 [0.049, 0.146]; G1 24/8,469 = 0.28% (the 6-decimal rounding of
  the frozen column is handled at 1e-6, D1); c_exact 0.748; 3-pool 0.7845; eval-3 oracle 0.385 / 0.542. Z = 2,672 rows. LONG-strat
  AUROC: V0 0.743; Δ V1 -0.004, V2 +0.0075 [0.004, 0.011], V3 +0.007, V4 +0.009 [-0.004, 0.021], V5 +0.003. The pre-registered
  rule (Δ LONG >= +0.015, L25 >= V0, CTRL >= V0 - 0.01) gives 'NONE: V0 stands'. Stability: NONE 87.6%, V4 11.8%. Null: some
  variant qualifies in 3.5% of permutations. Mechanism: plurality normalisation trades d for e (ALL d 0.490 -> 0.174, e 0.140
  -> 0.343; MEANING_RENAME-type e 0.502 -> 0.872). No variant lowers d without raising e. The 9-family oracle gap is ILL_CONDITIONED
  (d_oracle 0.586 > d_V0 0.490). Marker M1 freeze/CONSENSUS_FREEZE_READY.json was written 12 min after the first code, with
  freeze/selection.json and consensus_variants.py (20-row reproduction to 1e-9). PART B ($0.22): GG = exact z3 equivalence
  OR an exhaustive injective arity-consistent symbol map giving z3 equivalence AND gemini-2.5-flash (non-thinking) says YES
  for every renamed pair. Checker gate G-A: dev v1 0.780 fails; the one allowed revision v2 scores 0.907 on the confirm half.
  G-B (R_COMP renames): 0.950 / 0.941, NOT_TESTABLE as a gate with only 53 YES pairs (D2). Dev gates: g1 SYN paired flip 0.034
  and g2 MEANING_RENAME recall 1.0 both pass, trivially because base FA is 0.83. g3 FAILS: E ALL-strat 0.696 vs V0 0.742,
  Δ -0.046 [-0.071, -0.021], so GG = FAIL(g3) and the boundary statement is written. GG halves error endorsement (e 0.140
  -> 0.081; MEANING_RENAME-type 0.502 -> 0.224) but raises d (0.490 -> 0.629): all 678 granularity (gran) pairs fail the bijection
  prefilter and 268 align pairs are gloss-rejected. Cost per candidate: 0.038 CPU-s + <= $0.00005. Secondary GG_B (freelab
  B1-B5 bridges) searched 11,202 pairs; its gloss is UNTESTED(budget) because the run-level OpenRouter budget was exhausted
  (HTTP 403, D13). Its all-accepted bracket is worse (ALL-strat 0.653; e 0.334): the bridges absorb ADD/DROP errors. PART
  C: lib/api.py over byte-identically vendored code (lib/PROVENANCE.json sha256), with modes align/exact/nf/hyb/pn/rw/gg,
  graded_consensus, pairwise_matrix/ed_decomposition, peer_text_score, eqmv(+exhaustive), minimal_typed_repair, freelab labelling
  tools and FOL-Triage layers. smoke_lib.py passes on 10 E rows. Checks: 14 pytest tests pass; tests/audit_rederive.py re-derives
  the decision, the Δ (1e-9) and the GG gates; the shuffled-label placebo gives ~0.48-0.49. Outputs: method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out:
  E_heldout 8,507 rows with predict_V0..V5, c_exact, gg, gg_allyes, gg_b_allyes; PERTURB_E_bases 722; GG_checker_gates 1,069),

<previous_round_strands>
How you classified the PREVIOUS round's artifacts, one per bet. Use it for the
BROKEN-FIXED-ONCE rule: a bet that was "broken" then and is "broken" again now is
not a defect any more — drop it and give its slot to a new candidate. A "lead" that
you already deepened once and that came back "null" is the one case where widening
off a lead is allowed.

--- Strand 1 ---
artifact: art_D7k2ZWgE3nVd
state: 'null'
why: >-
  CSC strat 0.614 [.493,.736] vs FREE exact .770 (Δ −.156 CI<0); anchoring e .459 vs .173; G1 fail, G2 NOT_READ; completion-selected
  subset but clear negative

--- Strand 2 ---
artifact: art_pAmLrGqsmFUx
state: broken
why: >-
  0 CSC peers generated (budget 403); G3-P/G4/MT untested; $0 arms are out-of-scope SIGPROXY or trivial (FREE recall≈1 at
  base FA .71-.99)

--- Strand 3 ---
artifact: art_2OmxzMInZZJY
state: broken
why: >-
  Budget stop after 30/550 sentences: 0 CORRECT, no testable cell; drift stop rule UNDECIDED (track-H flag .12 vs .84 on 22
  items)

--- Strand 4 ---
artifact: art_Ia_FT284H33j
state: broken
why: >-
  Gloss step not run so CORRECT class empty, FREE AUROC untestable; search sound (0/1,595 false ERROR_CERT) and shows old
  FREE labels over-call ERROR

--- Strand 5 ---
artifact: art_BvAL_KZTZuw8
state: lead
why: >-
  Label-based: 61-77% of peers disagreeing with CORRECT candidates are ERROR; only 9% vocab-resolvable; d is peer error not
  vocabulary; oracle d L25 .542 vs .735

title: Consensus vs LLM judges on fresh logic data
summary: >-
  E2-A (iter 5): the pre-registered confirmation of frozen cross-family consensus c_score_align (V0) on the untouched E2 NL->FOL
  set. STATUS PARTIAL / NOT_TESTABLE: the run-level OpenRouter 'Test idea' budget ($12, shared) ran out at ~11:40 UTC after
  this artifact spent $2.05; key polled to the pre-registered 15:30 cutoff, never recovered. Done: drift gate PASS (panel
  majority agreement 0.955 on 269 items, providers pinned, M2 e2/E2_DRIFT_DECISION.json); all 5,500 candidates (550 sentences
  x 10 slots) generated; solver labels for all; panel labels only for the first sha1-order prefix of 110 sentences (37 L25/37
  EXC/36 DT; random prefix); every label-free score sealed before labels (V0, PT, c_exact, V1-V5, L2, L3, user's pilot metrics,
  local Qwen3-8B judge both views); flash-lite judge on 707 rows only; nano/round trip not run. RESULTS on the prefix (R_AB,
  strat AUROC, sentence-cluster bootstrap B=2000): long pool 94 rows (76 ERR/18 COR) -> (a) NOT_TESTABLE, (b) not testable,
  (c) NOT_TESTABLE in R_COMP sibling. DT (179 rows, prover-built gold): V0 0.916 [0.858,0.970] vs local judge 0.913, delta
  +0.003 [-0.042,+0.052]; ALL (273): V0 0.890, S4 stack 0.931, [S4+V0]-S4 -0.009 [-0.034,+0.014] -> consensus ties a local
  8B judge and adds nothing over it. User's pilot metrics do NOT track correctness: joint-conflict 0.500, arity 0.507, shape
  0.510, dangling 0.413 (inverted); only 1-rerun-Jaccard 0.713 (a lexical cross-system agreement proxy). V0 is not rename-invariant:
  nonce-renamed correct formulas flagged 100% (n=145, base 0.26), synonym 94% (n=36). H-MECH: (i) 0.909 of peers disagreeing
  with CORRECT candidates are ERROR; (iv) ALIGN lowers false alarms 0.74->0.18 but endorses more rename-type errors; (ii)
  NOT_READ; (iii) CI includes 0. H-IMPROVE: V0 stands (freeze winner NONE); H-RENAME NOT CONFIRMED (GG failed dev gate). E2-B
  union adds no R_AB rows. Headline numbers independently re-derived (audit/rederive.py, sklearn from raw files, exact match;
  shuffled-label placebo 0.497). FILES: per_item_E2A.jsonl (scores+labels; M3 marker e2/E2A_FINAL_READY.json with sha256),
  scores_E2A.jsonl + score_seal.json, e2src/sealed/labels_E2.jsonl, results/*.json, tables.md, method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out,
  predict_* higher=ERROR), lib/nl2fol_metrics.py (reusable (text,fol,peers) metrics with 'measures / does not measure' docstrings),
  deviations.json (17), README.md. Resume scripts finish the full test if the budget is raised.

summary: >-
  E2-B (iteration 5, gen_art_experiment_12): a pre-registered second untouched L25 sample (MALLS-train, >=25 words, >=3 conditions)
  for confirming frozen cross-family consensus V0 = c_score_align against LLM judges. STATUS: PARTIAL, NOTHING CONFIRMATORY.
  The run-level OpenRouter budget ($12, shared by all concurrent artifacts) was exhausted at 11:39 UTC, after this artifact
  had spent $0.83; every later paid call returned HTTP 403, and probes until 14:41 all failed. WHAT EXISTS: (1) 400 sentences
  drawn by E2's frozen sha1 rule (E2 pool reproduced byte-exactly; 98 surplus + 302 continuation; 93.5% 25-29 words; 0 collisions
  with E/E2; reserve 150), with prereg_iter5_E2B.json frozen before generation. (2) 4,000 candidates from E2's 10 frozen generator
  slots (parse rate 0.883). (3) Solver labels for all 400 sentences with E2's byte-identical code (78 files hash-verified).
  The blind panel completed NO batch (the incomplete batch is excluded), so labels are E's final rule without votes: 48 CORRECT
  / 334 ERROR (tier A vs UNAUDITED MALLS gold), 3,151 UNRESOLVED, 467 UNPARSEABLE. R_AB has no CORRECT class; R_A_UNAUDITED
  misses E's testability floor (48 < 50), so B1-B4 and the union U1-U4 are NOT TESTABLE; E2-A's M3 never appeared. (4) Label-free
  scores, sealed before the join under a file-access guard: V0/PT via exp-5 code (reproduces stored E values 50/50), V1-V5
  (M1 winner NONE), flash-lite disguised on 2,735 rows in batch order; nano, flash-lite original, deepseek and the frontier
  run were refused (frontier 10-row pilot only). EXPLORATORY numbers (analysis/tables.md; not a faithfulness test, because
  CORRECT = z3-equivalent to an unaudited gold): V0 strat AUROC 0.737 [0.645, 0.827] vs flash-lite disguised 0.496; V0 - flash-lite
  +0.208 [0.066, 0.363] on 276 paired rows (31 CORRECT); nested [S4+V0]-S4 +0.120 [0.013, 0.237]. A label-coupling diagnostic
  shows about half of this gap is structural: with gold-equivalent peers removed, V0 falls to 0.611 and its lead to +0.133
  [-0.024, 0.314]. Label-free: cross-family agreement 13.4% of pairs; Spearman(V0, flash-lite) 0.296; rename paired flips
  0.088 (SYN) / 0.107 (NONCE), reverse flips 0, shuffled-peer placebo AUROC 0.50. V0 costs $0 marginal and 0.06 s of z3 per
  candidate. Every headline number was re-derived independently (analysis/rederive_headline.json); the permuted-label and
  random-score placebos fail as required. Everything is resumable: if budget returns, e2bsrc/src_e2b/run_batches_resume.sh,
  src/judge_resume.sh and src/finalize.sh complete the plan. src/union.py runs later with --e2a <E2-A per-row file>. See README.md,
  deviations.json.

  V2 reliability-weighted (out-of-fold family weights), V3 = V1+V2, V4 cross-fitted exact/align logistic, V5 = V3 on the 3-pool.
  Gates reproduce exactly: G0 V0 strat 0.7415 and Δ +0.099 [0.049, 0.146]; G1 24/8,469 = 0.28% (the 6-decimal rounding of
  the frozen column is handled at 1e-6, D1); c_exact 0.748; 3-pool 0.7845; eval-3 oracle 0.385 / 0.542. Z = 2,672 rows. LONG-strat
  AUROC: V0 0.743; Δ V1 -0.004, V2 +0.0075 [0.004, 0.011], V3 +0.007, V4 +0.009 [-0.004, 0.021], V5 +0.003. The pre-registered
  rule (Δ LONG >= +0.015, L25 >= V0, CTRL >= V0 - 0.01) gives 'NONE: V0 stands'. Stability: NONE 87.6%, V4 11.8%. Null: some
  variant qualifies in 3.5% of permutations. Mechanism: plurality normalisation trades d for e (ALL d 0.490 -> 0.174, e 0.140
  -> 0.343; MEANING_RENAME-type e 0.502 -> 0.872). No variant lowers d without raising e. The 9-family oracle gap is ILL_CONDITIONED
  (d_oracle 0.586 > d_V0 0.490). Marker M1 freeze/CONSENSUS_FREEZE_READY.json was written 12 min after the first code, with
  freeze/selection.json and consensus_variants.py (20-row reproduction to 1e-9). PART B ($0.22): GG = exact z3 equivalence
  OR an exhaustive injective arity-consistent symbol map giving z3 equivalence AND gemini-2.5-flash (non-thinking) says YES
  for every renamed pair. Checker gate G-A: dev v1 0.780 fails; the one allowed revision v2 scores 0.907 on the confirm half.
  G-B (R_COMP renames): 0.950 / 0.941, NOT_TESTABLE as a gate with only 53 YES pairs (D2). Dev gates: g1 SYN paired flip 0.034
  and g2 MEANING_RENAME recall 1.0 both pass, trivially because base FA is 0.83. g3 FAILS: E ALL-strat 0.696 vs V0 0.742,
  Δ -0.046 [-0.071, -0.021], so GG = FAIL(g3) and the boundary statement is written. GG halves error endorsement (e 0.140
  -> 0.081; MEANING_RENAME-type 0.502 -> 0.224) but raises d (0.490 -> 0.629): all 678 granularity (gran) pairs fail the bijection
  prefilter and 268 align pairs are gloss-rejected. Cost per candidate: 0.038 CPU-s + <= $0.00005. Secondary GG_B (freelab
  B1-B5 bridges) searched 11,202 pairs; its gloss is UNTESTED(budget) because the run-level OpenRouter budget was exhausted
  (HTTP 403, D13). Its all-accepted bracket is worse (ALL-strat 0.653; e 0.334): the bridges absorb ADD/DROP errors. PART
  C: lib/api.py over byte-identically vendored code (lib/PROVENANCE.json sha256), with modes align/exact/nf/hyb/pn/rw/gg,
  graded_consensus, pairwise_matrix/ed_decomposition, peer_text_score, eqmv(+exhaustive), minimal_typed_repair, freelab labelling
  tools and FOL-Triage layers. smoke_lib.py passes on 10 E rows. Checks: 14 pytest tests pass; tests/audit_rederive.py re-derives

# Gold-Free Faithfulness Metrics for NL-to-FOL Translation

## Framing

Translating natural language into first-order logic (NL-FOL) is a prerequisite for neurosymbolic reasoning pipelines [10], yet evaluating whether a candidate formula faithfully captures a sentence's meaning remains an open problem. Gold FOL annotations are expensive, non-unique, and unreliable: Brunello et al. [3] found that approximately 42% of entries in both FOLIO [1] and MALLS [2] contain incorrect formalisations. Existing metrics either require a gold formula (exact match, prover-checked equivalence) or only verify that the output parses [5, 6]. The user's own pilot study used structural consistency checks (arity agreement, predicate-set overlap across reruns, joint satisfiability) that measure stability but not whether a formula says what its sentence says.

This run investigates gold-free metrics that predict faithfulness to the text given only a sentence and a candidate formula, with no reference formula, no ontology, and no domain knowledge. The evaluation is a meta-evaluation: we build a labelled set of (sentence, formula) pairs from public benchmarks whose gold has been audited, and measure each metric's ability to discriminate correct translations from errors.

## Iteration 1

### 1.1 Strategy

The iteration screens four candidate metric families head-to-head on a frozen evaluation set, with a disguised cheap LLM judge as the bar to beat.

**Candidates.** (A) FOL-Triage, a three-layer cascade: L1 (formula lint: deterministic formula smells), L2 (text accounting: bag-of-words and role-aware coverage), and L3 (role questionnaire: a small LLM reads the text and z3 reads the formula; their structured answers are compared). (B) Round-trip verification: verbalise the formula back to natural language and compare to the original via NLI or embedding similarity [7]. (C) Cross-system consensus: collect translations of the same sentence from multiple independent systems, measure z3-equivalence between the candidate and the peer pool, and score disagreement [8]. (D) Disguised cheap judge and baselines: an LLM judge, structural pilot metrics, and round-trip features evaluated on nonce-disguised sentences to control for memorisation.

**Evaluation set.** The frozen screen uses Logic-LM [10] released outputs on FOLIO validation: three LLM systems (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, text-davinci-003) producing 796 items. Track L contains LLM outputs labelled by z3 equivalence to corrected gold [4]; track H contains the 294 original human gold formulas, of which 57 are errors according to the corrected labels. The parallel run (run_qY2a2IS-WLIs) measured 43.9% of solver-non-equivalent candidates as faithful by a three-family panel; iteration 2 will re-score with those adjudicated labels.

**Decision rule.** A candidate must achieve AUROC ≥ 0.65 on track L (ERROR vs CORRECT), with coverage ≥ 90%, rewrite false-alarm rate ≤ 10% per rewrite family, and cost ≤ $0.002 per item. It advances only if its AUROC exceeds the disguised cheap judge's, with a paired bootstrap CI excluding zero.

**Development dataset (Artifact E).** A separate 700-sentence, 8,507-row development set was constructed from FOLIO training premises, MALLS training long/conditional/exception strata, and FOLIO curated conclusions, each translated by 9 LLM families plus ccg2lambda plus GPT-4 gold. Labels were assigned by z3 equivalence to audited gold, with contested cases adjudicated by a three-member panel (Claude Haiku-4.5, GLM-4.6, Kimi-K2). This set is reserved for iteration 2 confirmation. [ARTIFACT:art_U4Hsqt4Ay9Tg]

The dataset contains 1,750 CORRECT, 5,005 ERROR, 1,086 UNPARSEABLE, 276 UNRESOLVED, and 390 CONTESTED items. The panel calibration subset (173 items) shows that the panel agrees with expert-corrected labels on both faithful and unfaithful items. A screen audit of 1,173 items from the Logic-LM screen confirms the label assignment. The dataset cost $9.83 in API calls.

### 1.2 Experiment A: FOL-Triage

[ARTIFACT:art_d0njuqy2Csj-]

FOL-Triage was evaluated on the frozen screen with Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite as the primary LLM for L3. Total API spend was $0.29.

#### Headline AUROCs (track L, ERROR vs CORRECT, n = 477, 199 errors)

| Metric | AUROC | 95% CI | AUPRC |
|-|-|-|-|
| L1 (any smell) | 0.508 | [0.499, 0.519] | 0.425 |
| L2 bag-of-words | 0.737 | [0.677, 0.801] | 0.690 |
| L2 role-aware | 0.557 | [0.527, 0.594] | 0.476 |
| L3 score | 0.756 | [0.701, 0.809] | 0.657 |
| Fused (fitted on H, no leak) | 0.759 | [0.695, 0.825] | 0.740 |
| Fused (all H) | 0.827 | [0.778, 0.874] | 0.771 |
| Fused (cross-fit L) | 0.864 | [0.824, 0.902] | 0.789 |
| Decomposed judge (LLM reads formula) | 0.716 | [0.645, 0.789] | 0.717 |
| L3 with local Qwen2.5-1.5B | 0.708 | [0.637, 0.774] | 0.603 |

The primary no-leak fused score is 0.759. The fused-all-H and cross-fit-L numbers (0.827, 0.864) are shown for completeness but are not valid held-out estimates: the former uses the full track H for fitting, and the latter is a within-L cross-fit that overstates generalisation.

**Track H (human gold errors, n = 258, 57 errors).** Fused out-of-fold AUROC is 0.777 [0.698, 0.847]. L1 alone reaches 0.655, compared to 0.508 on track L. The lint rules fire on human annotation errors but not on LLM outputs, because the two populations produce different formula smells.

#### L1 lint: a negative result on LLM outputs

L1 flags formulas with deterministic smells (existential implication, free variables, arity clashes, vacuity, trivial formulas, dangling predicates). On track L, the true positive rate is 2.0% at a false positive rate of 0.4%, giving AUROC 0.508. This is a negative result: L1 lint does not transfer from human annotation errors (where it is effective, AUROC 0.655) to LLM outputs. The reason is that LLM-generated formulas rarely contain the syntactic pathologies L1 detects; their errors are semantic (wrong predicates, missing conditions, scope mistakes).

All nine individual smell rules have false-alarm rates below 3% on every system:

| Smell | gpt-3.5 FA | gpt-4 FA | davinci-003 FA |
|-|-|-|-|
| EX_IMP | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| ALL_AND | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| IFF_RESTR | 0.0 | 0.009 | 0.0 |
| GLUE | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| FREE | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| VACUOUS | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| TRIVIAL | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| ARITY | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| DANGLING | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

Only the FREE smell fires on any track-L errors (4 items).

#### L2 role-aware check: below bag-of-words

The role-aware UD-based check (L2-role) achieves AUROC 0.557, which is 0.18 below the simpler bag-of-words check (L2-bow, 0.737). The role-aware layer adds no discriminative power over word overlap.

#### Decomposed judge ablation

Replacing z3 with an LLM that reads the formula directly (the decomposed judge) drops L3 AUROC from 0.756 to 0.697 (ΔAUROC = −0.059). The LLM gets only 57.6% of binary argument slots correct on track L and 36.4% on track H. The z3 answerer is significantly more accurate for structured formula reading.

#### Per-type sensitivity (track L, at binary threshold)

| Error type | n | L1 | L2-bow | L2-role | L3 | Fused | Cascade |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| NEG | 5 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 1.0 |
| QUANT | 2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| CONN | 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| DROP | 142 | 0.028 | 0.479 | 0.127 | 0.197 | 0.599 | 0.606 |
| ADD | 150 | 0.020 | 0.473 | 0.107 | 0.173 | 0.653 | 0.573 |
| SWAP | 12 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.083 | 0.25 | 0.083 | 0.333 |
| BIND | 8 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.375 | 0.25 |
| COMPOUND | 187 | 0.118 | 0.428 | 0.166 | 0.160 | 0.599 | 0.578 |

FOL-Triage is most sensitive to ADD and DROP errors (the largest categories), with the fused score catching about 60%. It misses CONN errors entirely (0/4) and detects SWAP poorly (1/12). Negation errors are fully caught by the cascade (which fires L2-role, where monotonicity shifts are visible) but L1 and L2-bow miss them.

On track H (57 errors), the per-type pattern differs. UNGLUE errors (n = 5) are caught at 100% by L1 and the fused score, because they produce detectable formula smells.

#### Per-type sensitivity (track H)

| Error type | n | L1 | L2-bow | L2-role | L3 | Fused | Cascade |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| NEG | 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.25 |
| REV | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| QUANT | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| RESTR | 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| CONN | 8 | 0.25 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.375 | 0.375 | 0.375 |
| MOVE | 2 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| DROP | 14 | 0.143 | 0.357 | 0.0 | 0.143 | 0.357 | 0.5 |
| ADD | 19 | 0.158 | 0.368 | 0.053 | 0.211 | 0.526 | 0.579 |
| SWAP | 2 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| BIND | 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| UNGLUE | 5 | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| COMPOUND | 33 | 0.303 | 0.182 | 0.242 | 0.182 | 0.545 | 0.636 |

#### Invariance under meaning-preserving rewrites

Five rewrite families were tested on 150 track-L CORRECT items. The table shows the false-alarm rate on the rewritten formula and the flip rate (fraction of items whose binary verdict changes):

| Rewrite | n applies | L1 FA | L1 flip | bow FA | bow flip | role FA | role flip | L3 FA | L3 flip | Fused FA | Fused flip |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| RENAME | 150 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.18 | 0.093 | 0.013 | 0.0 | 0.033 | 0.007 | 0.22 | 0.013 |
| REORDER | 34 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.029 | 0.0 | 0.059 | 0.0 | 0.059 | 0.0 | 0.235 | 0.0 |
| DEMORGAN | 33 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.030 | 0.0 | 0.061 | 0.0 | 0.030 | 0.030 | 0.182 | 0.061 |
| CONTRAPOSITIVE | 40 | 0.025 | 0.025 | 0.10 | 0.0 | 0.025 | 0.025 | 0.025 | 0.0 | 0.275 | 0.0 |
| PRENEX | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

The rewrite false-alarm gate (≤ 10% per family) fails. The worst-family fused FA is 0.275 (CONTRAPOSITIVE), but this equals the FA on the original formulas; the flip rate is at most 0.061. The high FA is not caused by the rewrites but by the fused score's calibration: it was fitted on track H where the CORRECT base rate is higher, producing a systematic over-flagging on track L (FA on track-L CORRECT items is 0.194 versus the 0.10 calibration target).

L1, L2-role, and L3 individually pass the 10% gate. L2-bow fails only under RENAME (FA = 0.18), because renaming predicates breaks the bag-of-words match between text and formula.

[FIGURE:fig_rewrite_fa]

#### Coverage

| Track | n | Parseable | Full coverage rate |
|-|-|-|-|
| L | 753 | 693 | 0.920 |
| H | 302 | 279 | 0.924 |

Parse rates by system: gpt-3.5-turbo 0.889, gpt-4 0.946, text-davinci-003 0.921. Unparseable outputs are scored as p = 1 (maximum error probability) by the fused metric, so all items receive a score. The coverage gate (≥ 90%) passes.

#### Cost

L1 and L2 are free (CPU-only). L3 costs $0.175 per 1,000 calls with Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite. The total per-item cost is $0.0002, passing the $0.002 gate. CPU time (L1 + L2 + z3): median 35 ms, P95 90 ms. L3 latency: median 630 ms, P95 1.68 s.

#### Contamination check

L3 was run on nonce-disguised sentences (content words replaced by nonsense words) on the full track L. AUROC with exact text-formula alignment: 0.765; with disguised text: 0.770. Paired difference: −0.005 [−0.063, 0.049]. There is no evidence that the LLM benefits from having seen the public benchmark sentences.

#### Complexity strata (track L, fused score)

| Stratum | n (error/correct) | Testable | Fused AUROC | L2-bow AUROC | L3 AUROC |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| words < 12 | 443 (179/264) | Yes | 0.781 | 0.742 | 0.772 |
| words 12-19 | 31 (18/13) | No | 0.521 | 0.596 | 0.541 |
| words ≥ 20 | 3 (2/1) | No | 0.500 | 1.000 | 0.000 |
| 0 quantifiers | 302 (130/172) | Yes | 0.743 | 0.728 | 0.771 |
| 1 quantifier | 164 (65/99) | Yes | 0.794 | 0.748 | 0.721 |
| ≥ 2 quantifiers | 11 (4/7) | No | 0.750 | 0.768 | 0.607 |
| depth ≤ 1 | 296 (124/172) | Yes | 0.762 | 0.745 | 0.779 |
| depth 2-3 | 173 (73/100) | Yes | 0.756 | 0.717 | 0.710 |
| depth ≥ 4 | 8 (2/6) | No | 0.667 | 0.750 | 0.500 |
| 0 conditions | 344 (145/199) | Yes | 0.775 | 0.759 | 0.791 |
| 1-2 conditions | 131 (54/77) | Yes | 0.716 | 0.677 | 0.628 |

The frozen screen is dominated by short, simple sentences (93% under 12 words). The long and complex strata (12+ words, 2+ quantifiers, 3+ conditions) have too few items to test. This limitation motivates the development dataset (Artifact E), which oversamples these strata.

#### Per-system AUROC (descriptive, n = 3 systems)

| System | n | Error rate | Fused AUROC | L1 AUROC | L2-bow AUROC | L3 AUROC |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | 143 | 0.378 | 0.689 | 0.500 | 0.650 | 0.722 |
| gpt-4 | 177 | 0.367 | 0.700 | 0.496 | 0.716 | 0.720 |
| text-davinci-003 | 157 | 0.510 | 0.857 | 0.525 | 0.811 | 0.817 |

FOL-Triage is most discriminative on text-davinci-003, the weakest system. The Kendall τ between system error rates and mean fused scores is 0.333 (3 systems, descriptive only).

#### Label quality observations

The track-L label distribution reveals a systematic issue: 58.8% of typed ERROR items have only ADD+DROP repair operators. On inspection, most of these are vocabulary or arity choices (e.g. Lunch(james) vs HasLunch(james, company)) that the vocabulary aligner cannot bridge. These are likely CORRECT under a looser equivalence definition. The track-H original gold has 27.1% error rate (errors, uncertain, and reading-choice items) and 5.8% unparseable rate. Among non-equivalent parseable items, 21.9% are correct-but-not-equivalent (VOCAB or GRAN class).

### 1.3 Experiment C: Cross-System Consensus

[ARTIFACT:art_i3cVDxBp-USk]

The consensus metric collects translations of the same sentence from multiple independent LLM families, checks pairwise z3 equivalence, and scores each candidate by its disagreement with the pool. Total API spend was $1.52.

#### Headline AUROCs (track L, ERROR vs CORRECT, n = 546, 249 errors)

[FIGURE:fig_consensus_auroc]

The c_score achieves the highest AUROC in the iteration at 0.866. It beats SC-5 (the self-consistency baseline) by ΔAUROC = +0.140 [0.085, 0.197]. Cross-family consensus also exceeds sampling self-consistency in the related SAC3 framework [17], which uses semantic-aware cross-check consistency for hallucination detection in black-box LLMs. Using only the six fresh peer translations (not the three Logic-LM systems) gives 0.872, slightly higher than using all peers. Restricting to the two other Logic-LM systems drops the AUROC to 0.753, showing that diversity across model families is essential.


The misalignment score (0.835) is high because CORRECT items are by construction alignable to the gold in the labeller, so misalignment alone is a strong proxy for error. This does not generalise to settings without a shared vocabulary.

#### RENAME rewrite invariance: failure

Under predicate renaming (replacing predicate names with WordNet synonyms or nonce names), the c_score false-alarm rate is 96% (100% for constant-only renaming). This is expected and fundamental: two formulas with different predicate names are not z3-equivalent, so any rename breaks the equivalence check. The consensus metric is invariant to rewrites that preserve z3 equivalence (reordering, De Morgan, contrapositive) but not to vocabulary changes.

#### Blind-spot analysis

38% of ERROR items are z3-equivalent to the medoid (the most popular peer formula). This places a ceiling on recall of approximately 62%. The blind-spot rate is 5% for polarity errors and 57% for structural errors.

#### Cost

The peer pool costs $0.0015 per sentence (6 peers via API). Total experiment spend: $1.52. z3 pairwise equivalence checking is free.

### 1.4 Experiment D: Disguised Judge and Baselines

[ARTIFACT:art_elDZY26Pu6GD]

This experiment establishes the bar: every baseline metric and every judge variant on the same shared screen, scored with nonce-disguised sentences to control for memorisation. Total API spend was $2.02 (after the OpenRouter key was restored at 15:11 UTC; local judges ran during the outage and are kept as secondary rows).

#### The bar: disguised cheap judge

The primary cheap judge (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, JSON 0-100 scoring, nonce-disguised sentences) achieves AUROC 0.777 [0.720, 0.827] on track L (n = 524, 230 errors, 294 correct).

[FIGURE:fig_baseline_auroc]

#### Pilot structural metrics: negative result

The user's pilot structural metrics are null on this screen. Joint conflict achieves AUROC 0.513, arity inconsistency 0.500, shape inconsistency 0.524, dangling predicates 0.533, and undeclared predicates 0.525. The cross-system predicate-set Jaccard (pilot_rerun_jacc) reaches 0.720, the only pilot metric with signal, but this is a proxy for the consensus approach tested in Experiment C.

#### Round-trip verification

Round-trip NLI (verbalise the formula, compare to the original sentence via bidirectional NLI entailment) achieves AUROC 0.710 [0.648, 0.769]. This is 0.067 below the cheap judge (p = 0.008 by DeLong test). The round-trip reformalisation check (verbalise, re-translate to FOL, check z3 equivalence with the original) achieves only 0.513, because 76% of items tie at the same score.

Round-trip NLI using local verbalisation (the LLM verbalises on the local GPU instead of the API) reaches 0.740 [0.680, 0.796], slightly higher than the API version.

#### Frontier judge

The strong judge (Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview) achieves AUROC 0.802 [0.715, 0.877] on the strong subsample (n = 291). Under disguise it drops to 0.730 [0.655, 0.803]. The ΔAUROC over the cheap judge is +0.024 [−0.075, 0.111], not significant under solver labels. Under panel labels the frontier-judge advantage strengthens to +0.166 [+0.086, +0.244] (p < 0.001, n = 90; see §2.5 item 5).

#### Cross-fitted baseline combinations (track L)

| Combination | AUROC | 95% CI |
|-|-|-|
| S1 (structural) | 0.698 | [0.634, 0.761] |
| S2 (round-trip) | 0.687 | [0.625, 0.749] |
| S3 (judges disguised) | 0.771 | [0.705, 0.831] |
| S4 (all cheap features) | 0.817 | [0.762, 0.867] |
| S6 (S4 + local judges) | 0.810 | [0.753, 0.861] |

S4 (all cheap features combined via cross-fitted logistic regression) achieves 0.817. This is +0.039 [−0.010, 0.087] over the cheap judge alone, not significant, but it sets the empirical ceiling for cheap baselines.

#### Contamination analysis

No evidence of contamination was found for any judge. The difference-in-differences (DiD) test compares the disguise effect on track H (where the LLM could have memorised public gold) to track L (where it evaluates its own outputs, not memorisable). All DiD CIs include zero:

| Judge | DiD (H − L) | 95% CI |
|-|-|-|
| flash-lite | −0.042 | [−0.170, 0.094] |
| gpt-4.1-nano | −0.077 | [−0.188, 0.023] |
| gemini-3.1-pro | +0.002 | [−0.115, 0.104] |
| Qwen3-8B | −0.045 | [−0.161, 0.079] |
| Llama-3.1-8B | +0.023 | [−0.112, 0.157] |
| Qwen3-14B | −0.073 | [−0.195, 0.056] |

The gold-recall probe confirms this: when the primary model translates track-H sentences from scratch, it matches the corrected gold 15.9% of the time but the original (public) gold only 4.4%. Predicate-name Jaccard with the original gold minus Jaccard with the Logic-LM GPT-4 output is −0.068 [−0.171, 0.034]; the model is not reproducing the public gold.

#### Invariance of judges under meaning-preserving rewrites

Judges are highly sensitive to meaning-preserving rewrites. The FA on CONTRAPOSITIVE rewrites is 0.67 for the cheap judge (original), 0.51 for the cheap judge (disguised), and 0.95 for the cheap2 judge. This compares poorly to FOL-Triage's fused flip rate of 0.0 on CONTRAPOSITIVE.

The full invariance table (track L CORRECT items, n = 270):

| Metric | RENAME flip | REORDER flip | DEMORGAN flip | CONTRA flip | ALL flip |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| judge_cheap_orig | 0.27 | 0.12 | 0.23 | 0.64 | 0.29 |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.44 | 0.12 | 0.46 | 0.41 | 0.39 |
| judge_cheap2_orig | 0.49 | 0.12 | 0.46 | 0.95 | 0.49 |
| rt_nli_min | 0.37 | 0.10 | 0.31 | 0.33 | 0.31 |
| rt_embed_cos | 0.57 | 0.07 | 0.44 | 0.38 | 0.44 |
| FOL-Triage fused | 0.013 | 0.0 | 0.061 | 0.0 | 0.013 |

FOL-Triage has the lowest flip rate of any metric tested. Judges and round-trip methods change their verdict on 29-49% of meaning-preserving rewrites.

#### Per-error-type sensitivity of judges (track H, curator view, n = 46 errors)

| Group | n | judge_cheap_orig | judge_cheap_disg | judge_cheap2_orig | rt_nli_min |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1-op errors | 13 | 0.308 | 0.538 | 0.462 | 0.231 |
| 2-op errors | 11 | 0.545 | 0.818 | 0.727 | 0.273 |
| ADD | 12 | 0.500 | 0.750 | 0.667 | 0.250 |
| COMPOUND | 22 | 0.545 | 0.864 | 0.773 | 0.273 |
| DROP | 11 | 0.455 | 0.636 | 0.455 | 0.182 |
| CONN | 3 | 0.667 | 0.667 | 1.000 | 0.333 |
| NEG | 2 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 1.000 | 0.500 |
| SWAP | 2 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.500 | 0.000 |

The disguised judge is more sensitive than the original judge for most error types on the screen. [Correction (C2): on development set E at matched FA 0.10, the original judge has higher recall than the disguised judge (R_SOLVER_CONS diff +0.106 [0.033, 0.178]; R_ADJ_AB diff +0.198 [0.130, 0.260]). Disguise does not uniformly improve the judge; the screen-level pattern does not generalise.]

#### Judge error-type classification accuracy

The judge's ability to name the correct error type is poor. On track-H 1-op errors, it identifies the correct repair operator 0% of the time (0/12). On 2-op errors, it is correct 45% (5/11). On track L, accuracy is 20% for 1-op and 27% for 2-op errors.

#### Complexity analysis (track L)

A logistic regression of judge correctness on standardised word count yields a coefficient of −0.48 (SE 0.11, p < 0.001): the judge is significantly less reliable on longer sentences. On track H (where longer sentences are available), the coefficient is −0.14 (SE 0.17, p = 0.41), consistent in direction but underpowered.

| Stratum | n (err/cor) | judge_cheap_disg AUROC | rt_nli_min AUROC |
|-|-|-|-|
| words < 12 | 485 (210/275) | 0.784 | 0.713 |
| words 12-19 | 36 (18/18) | 0.667 | 0.670 |
| quantifiers 0-1 | 512 (226/286) | 0.784 | 0.712 |
| depth ≤ 3 | 466 (199/267) | 0.781 | 0.702 |

| 0 conditions | 394 (182/212) | 0.783 | 0.745 |
| 1-2 conditions | 128 (48/80) | 0.765 | 0.653 |

#### System-level descriptive statistics (3 systems, descriptive only)

| System | True error rate | Judge flag rate | rt_nli_min mean | Parse failures |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | 0.415 | 0.444 | 0.516 | 26/248 |

| text-davinci-003 | 0.527 | 0.553 | 0.663 | 20/266 |

#### API outage and robustness

The shared OpenRouter key was exhausted at 13:29 UTC and restored at 15:11 UTC. During the outage, all LLM judges ran on the local RTX 4000 Ada GPU with the same prompts (Qwen3-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-14B-nf4). After the key was restored, the API judges were run and designated as primary; the local judges are kept as secondary rows. The local Qwen3-8B judge achieves AUROC 0.757 (disguised), comparable to the API flash-lite judge at 0.777.

### 1.5 Iteration 1 Summary

The four candidates and the bar:

| Method | AUROC | 95% CI | n | Cost/item | Rewrite flip rate |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| c_score (consensus) | 0.866 | [0.821, 0.906] | 546 | $0.0015/sent | 96% (RENAME) |
| S4 baseline combo | 0.817 | [0.762, 0.867] | 524 | varies | varies |
| **Bar: judge_cheap_disg** | **0.777** | **[0.720, 0.827]** | **524** | **$0.00004** | **0.39** |
| FOL-Triage fused | 0.759 | [0.695, 0.825] | 477 | $0.0002 | 0.013 |
| rt_nli_min | 0.710 | [0.648, 0.769] | 524 | $0.00001 | 0.31 |
| L1 lint | 0.508 | [0.499, 0.519] | 477 | $0 | 0.0 |
| Pilot structural | 0.50-0.53 | n/a | 524 | $0 | n/a |

[FIGURE:fig_summary_comparison]

**What iteration 1 established:**

1. The cross-system consensus metric (c_score = 1 − eq_frac) achieves the highest AUROC at 0.866, beating SC-5 by +0.140. It requires peer translations from multiple model families and is fundamentally non-invariant to predicate renaming (96% FA under RENAME).

2. The disguised cheap judge sets the bar at AUROC 0.777. The S4 combination of all cheap features reaches 0.817 (+0.039, not significant). The frontier judge (Gemini 3.1 Pro) adds nothing significant over the cheap judge under solver labels; under panel labels the advantage strengthens (+0.166, p < 0.001).

3. FOL-Triage achieves AUROC 0.759, below the bar. Its primary value is invariance: the fused flip rate under meaning-preserving rewrites is 0.013, compared to 0.29-0.49 for judges. However, the fused false-alarm rate on CORRECT items is 0.194, exceeding the 0.10 calibration target.

4. L1 lint does not transfer from human annotation errors to LLM outputs. The pilot structural metrics are null. Round-trip NLI is 0.067 below the judge.

5. The evaluation labels are noisy: 58.8% of track-L "errors" are pure ADD+DROP (likely vocabulary mismatches). Iteration 2 will re-evaluate under panel-adjudicated labels from the development set.

6. No contamination was detected for any LLM-based metric.

**What remains for iteration 2:** (a) Re-evaluate all candidates under adjudicated labels from Artifact E. (b) Compute the paired ΔAUROC between FOL-Triage and the disguised judge on shared items. (c) Test whether combining the consensus metric with FOL-Triage or the judge produces a significant improvement. (d) Confirm on the development set.

## Iteration 2

### 2.1 Strategy

Iteration 2 has three goals: (i) confirm iteration 1's ordering on the development dataset E under both the solver labels (R_AB, R_A) and panel-adjudicated labels (R_ADJ); (ii) test whether fusing the consensus signal (PEER) with text-based checks (TEXT = L2-bow + L3) improves over each alone; and (iii) construct a typed perturbation suite (PERTURB) for controlled sensitivity testing.

The pre-registered bar for this iteration is the flash-lite judge on disguised sentences, with the local Qwen3-8B judge as fallback if the API is unavailable. The shared OpenRouter key hit its daily limit at 18:00 UTC on 2026-09-23, before the development-set experiment completed, and did not recover before the run deadline. The flash-lite bar is therefore UNTESTABLE on E; the fallback local judge (Qwen3-8B, rubric B, greedy; screen AUROC 0.757 vs 0.777 for flash-lite) is the labelled secondary bar for all rows reported below.

### 2.2 Experiment 5: PEER+TEXT on development dataset E

[ARTIFACT:art_TaxJRnPcJMuZ]

PEER+TEXT is a logistic fusion of the consensus signal (c_score with shared-vocabulary alignment, denoted c_score_align) and the text-based FOL-Triage layers (L2-bow, L3 questionnaire). The fusion weights were fitted on the iteration-1 screen and frozen before any E score was computed (prereg sha256 b9f28b1bf6bf). API spend was $0 (all components ran on CPU and the local GPU; no OpenRouter calls completed).

#### Name-free alignment: failed the pre-registered screen gate

A name-free variant of the consensus metric (graded clause consensus, g_score) was pre-registered as the primary PEER signal. It matches formula clauses by structural role without relying on shared predicate names, using anchored-cost assignment and Murty k-best matching. Under the pre-registered selection rule, both name-free variants (NF-pure and NF-anchored) failed the screen gate: for both, more than 10% of AGREE track-L CORRECT items tie at g = 1, making the deterministic false-alarm threshold degenerate (ROLE_PERMUTE recall = 0).

A post-hoc analysis with fractional tie-breaking showed this failure was a threshold-tie artefact. NF-anchored passes both gates under fractional scoring (RENAME FA 0.074, ROLE_PERMUTE recall 0.771); NF-pure still fails ROLE_PERMUTE (recall 0.186). The NF-anchored fusion was fitted post-hoc and applied to E as a labelled sensitivity analysis. On E (R_AB pooled), the NF-anchored fusion achieves AUROC 0.759 [0.72, 0.79], which is 0.031 below the pre-registered PEER+TEXT fusion (0.790), with the CI excluding zero [−0.042, −0.020]. The shared-aligner confound with the solver labeller remains open.

#### Headline AUROCs on E (R_AB, ERROR vs CORRECT)

| Subset | n (err/cor) | PEER+TEXT | c_score_align | NF c_score | L2-bow | L3 | Local judge |

| R_A pooled L20+EXC | 449 (261/188) | 0.818 [0.73, 0.88] | 0.860 [0.79, 0.92] | 0.802 [0.72, 0.87] | 0.678 [0.61, 0.74] | 0.587 [0.51, 0.66] | 0.554 |

[FIGURE:fig_dev_set_auroc]

#### PEER+TEXT vs the local judge

The paired ΔAUROC of PEER+TEXT minus the local judge is +0.078 [0.043, 0.112] on R_AB pooled (DeLong p < 0.0001). On the long pool (L25+L20+EXC), the gap widens to +0.115 [0.075, 0.157]. On R_A (tier-A adjudicated labels, L20+EXC), the gap is +0.264 [0.157, 0.359].

The flash-lite judge comparison is untestable: only 20 items received flash-lite scores before the key was exhausted, yielding a ΔAUROC of +0.057 [−0.200, 0.360] (n = 20, uninformative).

#### Does fusion beat c_score_align alone?

The stratified AUROC (pairing only within complexity strata, removing the composition confound) shows PEER+TEXT at 0.753 and c_score_align at 0.741, a difference of +0.011 [−0.012, 0.038], not significant. On the long pool the stratified gap is +0.016 [−0.010, 0.041]. On R_A the gap is −0.036 [−0.113, 0.030], favouring c_score_align. The TEXT layers add no significant discriminative power over c_score_align alone once the stratum-composition confound is removed.

#### Mechanism predictions

Four pre-registered mechanism predictions were tested on E:

**P1 (PEER catches COVERAGE errors that TEXT misses, and vice versa).** At matched false-alarm rate 0.10 with fractional tie-breaking: PEER has higher recall than TEXT on COVERAGE errors (+0.093 [0.046, 0.147]), and TEXT has higher recall on PEER_ENDORSED errors (+0.103 [0.051, 0.171]). [Correction (C5): the recall values for the local judge (Qwen-8B disguised) at FA 0.10 on the endorsed groups are: PEER_ENDORSED 0.169, PEER_ENDORSED_NF 0.199. The local judge has the highest recall on both endorsed groups, not the TEXT layers. The original report omitted the judge column and conflated the two endorsed-group names.] The crossover exists, but the fused PEER+TEXT recall is not higher than c_score_align alone on any group except COVERAGE. Verdict: INCONCLUSIVE.

**P2 (PEER and TEXT error rankings are uncorrelated).** Spearman correlation between PEER and TEXT among errors is 0.294 [0.224, 0.365]. This is moderate, not near zero. The gain from fusion over the best single signal (PEER) is only +0.042 AUROC, and the share from PEER-endorsed errors is −0.200, meaning TEXT hurts on items PEER already handles. Verdict: REFUTED.

**P3 (PEER+TEXT advantage grows with sentence complexity).** The logistic interaction term z(score)·z(words) is −0.023 [−0.228, 0.185] for PEER+TEXT, consistent with no interaction. The diff-in-Δ (long minus CTRL) of PEER+TEXT minus the local judge is +0.146 [0.020, 0.269], but this reflects the judge degrading on long sentences, not the fusion improving. Verdict: INCONCLUSIVE.

**P4 (PEER+TEXT is more invariant to meaning-preserving rewrites than judges).** On the screen pools, the fused score's RENAME false-alarm rate is 0.385 and the local judge's is 0.683. The fused score is better than judges but far worse than FOL-Triage fused (RENAME FA 0.22). [Correction (C6): the original report compared the fused RENAME FA 0.385 to "FOL-Triage's 0.013," but 0.013 was the FOL-Triage flip rate, not FA. The correct FA comparison is 0.385 vs 0.22.] The c_score_align component drives most of the fused FA under RENAME (0.859). Verdict: REFUTED.

#### Rewrite false alarms (screen, CORRECT bases)

| Rewrite | n | Fused | c_score_align | NF g | L2-bow | L3 | Local judge |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| RENAME | 104 | 0.385 | 0.859 | 0.074 | 0.216 | 0.168 | 0.683 |
| REORDER | 27 | 0.222 | 0.178 | 0.037 | 0.044 | 0.444 | 0.000 |
| DEMORGAN | 26 | 0.154 | 0.185 | 0.038 | 0.046 | 0.231 | 0.231 |
| CONTRAPOSITIVE | 28 | 0.107 | 0.063 | 0.237 | 0.075 | 0.188 | 0.214 |

The NF g_score has the lowest RENAME false-alarm rate (0.074) of any consensus-based signal, confirming the value of name-free matching. However, its CONTRAPOSITIVE FA (0.237) is higher than c_score_align's (0.063).

#### Error typing

On R_A errors with 1-2 typed repair operators (n = 453), the top-code accuracy of the medoid-ops typed repair is 0.371 (codable-only 0.561, n = 262). Chance level is 0.382. The local judge's type-classification accuracy is 0.022 (10/453). Error typing from automated metrics remains unreliable.

#### System-level correlation

Kendall τ-b of each metric vs the R_AB system error rate across 13 system × variant rows: PEER+TEXT 0.718, TEXT alone 0.769, PEER alone 0.692, local judge 0.667. All metrics track system quality at the aggregate level.

#### Contamination on E

The local Qwen3-8B judge shows a disguise effect in the unexpected direction: disguised AUROC (0.712) exceeds original AUROC (0.648) by +0.064 [0.032, 0.098]. [Correction (C1c): the sign of this effect is −0.064 [−0.098, −0.032], i.e. disguise improves the judge's AUROC. This does not mean disguise "forces structural reading"; see correction C2.] The DiD test (comparing the disguise effect on track H vs track L) yields +0.045 [−0.073, 0.161], with the CI including zero. No contamination is detected. [Correction (C1a/C1b): The iteration-2 baselines experiment (experiment 6) also ran a DiD on E. Llama-8B DiD = +0.162 [0.064, 0.261], significant and above MDE 0.139, raising a contamination concern for that judge. Qwen-8B DiD = +0.036 [−0.039, 0.111], n.s., MDE 0.107.] The PEER signal has no contamination channel, because it uses z3 equivalence (no text or names from the benchmark enter the scoring).

#### Coverage and cost

Of 8,507 rows, 7,421 (87.2%) are parseable and scored; 1,086 (12.8%) are unparseable (scored as maximum error probability). 38 rows have no peer translations available. The L3 questionnaire completed on all parseable rows. Mean CPU time per row: PEER pairs 0.026 s, NF pairs 0.208 s, TEXT 0.220 s. Mean cost per row for PEER+TEXT (L3 share): $0.000018. The local judge costs $0.000040 per row.

### 2.3 Evaluation 1: Re-evaluation under alternative label regimes

[ARTIFACT:art_HepAw8c6Eu7-]

The iteration-1 experiments used solver labels (R_SOLVER): a formula is CORRECT if z3 proves it equivalent to the audited gold, ERROR otherwise. This is conservative: formulas that are semantically faithful but use different vocabulary or granularity are counted as errors. The parallel run adjudicated a panel of labels (R_ADJ) on the same items, where three LLM judges vote on faithfulness given only the sentence and candidate. This evaluation re-scores all metrics under 13 label regimes on a common item set (588 items shared across experiments A, C, D, and E).

#### Rederivation audit

All 57 reviewer-audited quantities from the iteration-1 report reproduce exactly under independent recomputation (57/57 MATCH, tolerance ≤ 0.01 for AUROCs, ≤ 0.005 for bootstrap replicas). The reviewer's own RNG seed replicas match to ≤ 0.0005.

#### Regime AUROC matrix (common set, selected metrics)

| Metric | R_SOLVER | R_ADJ_AB | R_ADJ_A | R_ADJ_ALL |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| PT (PEER+TEXT) | 0.871 | 0.877 | 0.932 | 0.906 |
| fused_H (FOL-Triage) | 0.770 | 0.868 | 0.958 | 0.866 |
| c_score | 0.849 | 0.779 | 0.786 | 0.831 |
| L2-bow | 0.732 | 0.815 | 0.917 | 0.810 |
| L3 | 0.761 | 0.718 | 0.813 | 0.751 |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.782 | 0.772 | 0.751 | 0.816 |
| judge_cheap_orig | 0.754 | 0.797 | 0.858 | 0.785 |
| sc5_cheap | 0.713 | 0.703 | 0.676 | 0.737 |
| rt_nli_min | 0.709 | 0.749 | 0.731 | 0.760 |

Under R_ADJ_AB, PEER+TEXT (0.877) leads, followed by FOL-Triage fused (0.868) and L2-bow (0.815). The c_score drops from 0.849 (solver) to 0.779 (R_ADJ_AB), because the adjudicated labels reclassify many vocabulary-mismatch items as CORRECT, removing the easy wins for the consensus signal. Under R_ADJ_A (tier-A only, 75 common items), FOL-Triage reaches 0.958 and PEER+TEXT 0.932, both well above the judges.

#### Label regime shifts

On the 161 items shared between R_SOLVER and R_ADJ_AB (36 label changes), the label-only shift is:

| Metric | Shift | 95% CI | Direction |
|-|-|-|-|
| fused_H | +0.080 | [0.003, 0.171] | UP |
| L2-bow | +0.102 | [0.018, 0.192] | UP |
| c_score | −0.106 | [−0.255, 0.013] | INSIDE CI |
| judge_cheap_disg | +0.018 | [−0.094, 0.134] | INSIDE CI |

BOW and the fused score benefit from adjudicated labels (their AUROCs go up), because the vocabulary-mismatch items they flag correctly are now labelled CORRECT. The c_score shift is negative but not significant, consistent with its reliance on the same vocabulary alignment that the solver uses.

#### Flipped items

Between solver and adjudicated labels, 51 items flip from CORRECT to ERROR and 1 flips from ERROR to CORRECT. The fused score (FOL-Triage) flags 83% of the CORRECT→ERROR items at matched FA 0.20, while c_score flags only 34%. This indicates that the text-based layers detect errors that the solver misses (vocabulary-equivalent but semantically wrong).

#### Frontier vs cheap judge

On the subset where both frontier (Gemini 3.1 Pro) and cheap judge scores are available, the frontier judge's advantage strengthens from solver to panel labels. [Correction (C4): under solver labels the advantage is +0.077 [0.006, 0.154]; under panel A+B it grows to +0.166 [0.086, 0.244] (p < 0.001). The original report said the advantage "reverses" the iteration-1 finding; in fact it strengthens monotonically from solver to panel labels, because panel labels reclassify vocabulary-mismatch items the frontier judge handles better.]

#### Contamination on the common set

All DiD CIs include zero across all judges. The MDE (minimum detectable effect at 80% power) ranges from 0.12 to 0.21, so small contamination effects cannot be ruled out but no evidence was found. The gpt-4.1-nano judge shows significant single-track drops on H (AUROC disg−orig = −0.114 [−0.206, −0.028]), but the DiD with track L is +0.077 [−0.028, 0.190], not significant.

### 2.4 Dataset 3: R_COMP and PERTURB

[ARTIFACT:art_zcwCQgTqk6DN]

This artifact constructs two evaluation resources: R_COMP (long composed sentences with trusted FOL references) and PERTURB (a typed perturbation suite with z3-verified controls).

#### R_COMP: incomplete (OpenRouter key exhausted)

The R_COMP component generates long, complex sentences (≥ 25 words, ≥ 3 conditions) by composing atoms from a verified lexicon of 652 entries extracted from FOLIO and MALLS source formulas. Nine templates (T1-T9) produce sentences with weak and strong exception readings, each with a z3-verified reference formula. The composition pipeline selected 250 main + 100 reserve sentences from 5,109 filtered candidates.

The candidate generation, labelling, and adjudication phases did not run because the shared OpenRouter key hit its $50 daily limit at approximately 18:00 UTC, after $0.41 in lexicon-extraction calls. The key did not recover before the module's deadline. The replacement key arrived at 21:38 UTC but was already at its daily limit. R_COMP references are constructed deterministically and are correct by construction, but the LLM-generated candidate translations and their labels are absent.

#### PERTURB: complete

The typed perturbation suite applies 12 operator types to 300 base formulas (200 from dataset E, 100 from R_COMP sentences) to produce controlled mutants where the error type and direction are known by construction. All mutants are z3-verified: the DOWN mutant is z3-non-equivalent to the base and the matched CONTROL is z3-equivalent.

| Statistic | Value |
|-|-|
| Base formulas | 300 |
| Total mutants (DOWN + UP) | 4,234 |
| Matched controls | 868 |
| Total suite rows | 5,102 |
| Complete DOWN/UP pairs | 1,354 |
| z3 verification failures | 0 |
| Operator types | 12 (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE) |
| Cost | $0.41 |

Each perturbation row carries a known label (ERROR for DOWN mutants, CORRECT for controls) and a typed operator, enabling per-type sensitivity analysis without relying on automated error classification. The suite is fully deterministic and re-runnable.

### 2.5 Iteration 2 Summary

**What iteration 2 established:**

1. PEER+TEXT achieves AUROC 0.790 [0.75, 0.82] on the development dataset E (R_AB pooled, n = 2686), beating the local judge by +0.078 [0.043, 0.112] (DeLong p < 0.0001). On long sentences (L25+L20+EXC, n = 2300) the gap widens to +0.115 [0.075, 0.157]. The flash-lite judge bar is UNTESTABLE due to API key exhaustion (only 20 rows scored).

2. Fusion does not significantly beat c_score_align alone. The stratified AUROC difference (PEER+TEXT minus c_score_align) is +0.011 [−0.012, 0.038] on R_AB pooled. The TEXT layers add coverage on COVERAGE-type errors (+0.093 recall at matched FA) but hurt on PEER-endorsed errors (−0.200 share). The mechanism prediction P2 (uncorrelated error rankings) is REFUTED: Spearman(PEER, TEXT) = 0.294.

3. The name-free consensus variant (NF-anchored) failed the pre-registered screen gate due to a threshold-tie artefact. Post-hoc fractional scoring shows it passes both gates (RENAME FA 0.074, ROLE_PERMUTE recall 0.771) and achieves AUROC 0.759 on E, 0.031 below PEER+TEXT. The NF approach has the lowest RENAME false-alarm rate (0.074) of any consensus signal, confirming the value of vocabulary-independent matching, but was not used in the primary analysis.

4. Under adjudicated labels (R_ADJ_AB), the metric ranking changes. FOL-Triage fused rises from 0.770 (solver) to 0.868 (adjudicated). The c_score drops from 0.849 to 0.779. This is because adjudicated labels reclassify vocabulary-mismatch items as CORRECT, removing the consensus signal's easy wins. PEER+TEXT (0.877) still leads under adjudicated labels.

5. The frontier judge advantage is large under adjudicated labels (+0.166 AUROC over the cheap judge under R_ADJ_AB, p < 0.001), strengthening the non-significant iteration-1 finding under solver labels. Solver labels masked the frontier judge's advantage.

6. All 57 reviewer-audited numbers from iteration 1 reproduce exactly (57/57 MATCH).

7. The PERTURB suite (4,234 typed mutants + 868 controls, 12 operator types, all z3-verified) is complete and ready for per-type sensitivity analysis. R_COMP candidate generation is blocked on the OpenRouter key.

### 2.6 Experiment 6: Baselines on development set E (omitted from the original iteration-2 report)

[Correction: the iteration-2 report omitted the full baselines experiment on development set E. The results are recorded here for completeness.]

Experiment 6 scored all local and baseline metrics on the development dataset E under R_AB labels (n = 2686, 1822 ERROR / 864 CORRECT, 292 sentences). The primary local bar is the Qwen3-8B judge (disguised).

#### Pooled AUROCs on E (R_AB, selected metrics)

| Metric | AUROC [95% CI] |
|-|-|
| S4_local (all tiers) | 0.754 [0.715, 0.789] |
| S4_local (R_AB) | 0.748 [0.709, 0.782] |
| judge_local_qwen8b_disg | 0.710 [0.674, 0.746] |
| S4_local_noLLMjudge | 0.703 [0.660, 0.742] |
| sc5_local_eq_frac | 0.664 [0.617, 0.706] |
| pilot_rerun_jacc | 0.660 [0.621, 0.695] |
| judge_local_qwen8b_orig | 0.649 [0.604, 0.693] |
| judge_local_llama8b_disg | 0.636 [0.590, 0.681] |
| rt_nli_min_local | 0.626 [0.580, 0.673] |
| b2_score | 0.574 [0.529, 0.619] |
| pilot_shape_incons | 0.504 [0.499, 0.510] |
| parse_fail | 0.500 [0.500, 0.500] |

The cross-fitted S4_local stack (logistic regression over all local features) achieves 0.748, beating the local judge by +0.038 [0.005, 0.069]. The PEER+TEXT consensus signal adds +0.042 [0.013, 0.070] over S4_local on pooled AUROC.

#### System-level correlation (13 system × variant rows; descriptive)

The best system-level tracker is S4_local (all tiers): Kendall τ-b = 0.615 [0.513, 0.770] over 13 system × variant rows. Over 11 families: τ-b = 0.709 [0.600, 0.818].

### 2.7 Dead ends: B2 and R_ADJ

**Candidate B2 (decomposed z3 distinguishing-worlds reader): DROPPED.** Candidate B2 extended iteration-1's candidate B (template NLI + z3 distinguishing worlds) by having a non-thinking local reader classify z3-generated distinguishing models. The gate balanced accuracy on track-H corrected labels was 0.476 (target ≥ 0.85). The decomposed reader could not reliably interpret z3 countermodels. A post-hoc thinking-mode variant reached 0.786 balanced accuracy on 124/251 completed items, but this was not pursued because the non-thinking version had already settled negative. The b2_score AUROC on E (R_AB pooled) was 0.574, below every other non-null metric. B2 is DROPPED and not retried.

**R_ADJ adjudicator gate: DROPPED.** [Correction (C7, partial): dataset 2 (R_ADJ construction) spent $3.660.] The iteration-2 plan called for an LLM-adjudicated label regime (R_ADJ) using Sonnet-5 as primary adjudicator, with Grok-4.20 as secondary. Both adjudicators failed the gate:

| Adjudicator | Gate track-H balanced accuracy | Target |
|-|-|-|
| Sonnet-5 | 0.662 | ≥ 0.80 |
| Grok-4.20 | 0.527 | ≥ 0.80 |

Inter-adjudicator kappa was 0.497 on all items and 0.416 on real E rows. Sonnet-5 test-retest kappa was 0.834 with a flip rate of 0.07, indicating the adjudicator was internally consistent but systematically wrong on track-H items. Of 74 track-H pairs, Sonnet-5 judged 43% of expert-corrected originals as FAITHFUL (they should be UNFAITHFUL), producing a recall_unfaithful of 0.568. R_ADJ is DROPPED. All confirmation analyses use R_AB (solver labels with panel adjudication of contested items).

[Correction (C7): Iteration-2 total API spend was $4.229: experiment 5 $0.155, experiment 6 $0.000, dataset 2 $3.660, dataset 3 $0.414, evaluation 1 $0.000.]

**What remains:**

(a) Run the flash-lite judge on E when the OpenRouter key resets, to test the pre-registered bar. (b) Complete R_COMP candidate generation and labelling. (c) Score all metrics on the PERTURB suite for per-type sensitivity under known labels. (d) Re-fit the PEER+TEXT fusion under R_ADJ labels (the current fusion was calibrated on track H, not under solver labels). (e) Test whether a name-free fusion (NF-anchored + TEXT) closes the 0.031 gap with the aligner-based fusion when the aligner confound is removed.

## Iteration 3

### 3.1 Strategy

Iteration 3 resolves the two gaps that iteration 2 left open: the flash-lite API bar and the R_COMP candidate generation. It runs five pre-registered tests:

- **T1** (head-on API bar): score c_score_align and all baselines with API-tier judges on development set E. The bar is the best API cheap judge (flash-lite disguised). Success: stratified AUROC of c_score_align exceeds the bar with the 95% CI excluding zero.
- **T2** (R_COMP): generate candidate translations for the 221 R_COMP sentences (long composed sentences with trusted-by-construction references) and score all metrics. Success: within-template AUROC of consensus exceeds flash-lite disguised with the 95% CI excluding zero, under both SIG (shared vocabulary) and FREE (independent vocabulary) conditions.
- **T3** (PERTURB per-operator sensitivity): score the PERTURB suite with all metrics. Report within-base AUROC per operator per metric. No pass/fail gate; the table is descriptive.
- **T4** (mechanism verification): verify 48 numerical claims from the iteration-2 report via independent recomputation, and test four mechanism predictions (M1-M4) about why consensus works.
- **T5** (PERTURB rename tradeoff): measure the rename false-alarm rate and the MEANING_RENAME recall for each consensus variant on the PERTURB suite. This quantifies the cost of vocabulary alignment.

### 3.2 Test T1: Head-on API bar on development set E

[ARTIFACT:art_7GxreYjATkC5]

The shared OpenRouter key was available for this iteration. All API metrics (flash-lite judge, gpt-4.1-nano judge, Gemini 3.1 Pro frontier judge, API round-trip NLI, API SC-5) were scored on E. The population is E_POOL PRIMARY under R_AB: n = 2686 (1822 ERROR / 864 CORRECT, 292 sentences). All CIs are sentence-cluster percentile bootstrap (B = 2000, seed 0). "Strat" denotes within-stratum AUROC, where only ERROR/CORRECT pairs from the same source stratum contribute.

#### Verdict

| Criterion | Status | Key numbers |
|-|-|-|
| (a) c_score_align beats flash-lite disguised | **CONFIRMED** | R_AB strat Δ +0.099 [+0.049, +0.146]; long strat Δ +0.116 [+0.070, +0.163] |
| (b) adds signal beyond S4_full (nested) | **CONFIRMED** | strat Δ +0.039 [+0.021, +0.057]; permutation null p95 = 0.009 |
| (d) frontier ratio ≥ 0.95 at ≤ 10× cost | **CONFIRMED** | ratio 0.957 [0.887, 1.034]; cost ratio 30.2× cheaper |
| VEX confound control (sign > 0) | **CONFIRMED** | strat Δ +0.306 [+0.232, +0.376] |
| M3 length slope (consensus − judge) | **DISCONFIRMED** | words Δslope +0.146 [−0.051, +0.361]; n_conditions +0.116 [−0.044, +0.264] |

**Overall T1: CONFIRMED.** Robustness check against gpt-4.1-nano (the second-best API cheap judge): criterion (a) also CONFIRMED (R_AB strat Δ +0.089 [+0.043, +0.134]).

c_score_align achieves strat AUROC 0.741, beating the best API cheap judge (flash-lite disguised, 0.642) by +0.099 [+0.049, +0.146]. The PEER+TEXT fusion (p_peer_text) reaches 0.753 stratified. These are the only metrics whose strat CIs exclude the flash-lite bar.

Note: the flash-lite strat AUROC on E (0.642) is substantially below its iteration-1 screen AUROC (0.777 pooled). The screen was dominated by short, simple sentences with high base-rate discrimination; on the longer, harder E sentences, the judge's advantage shrinks. This is consistent with the iteration-1 observation that the screen has limited long-sentence coverage.

#### Paired deltas: challenger minus bar (stratified)

|-|-|-|-|
| R_AB pooled | 1822/864 | c_score_align | +0.099 [+0.049, +0.146] |
| R_AB pooled | 1822/864 | p_peer_text | +0.110 [+0.065, +0.154] |
| R_AB long (L25+L20+EXC) | 1673/627 | c_score_align | +0.116 [+0.070, +0.163] |
| R_AB long (L25+L20+EXC) | 1673/627 | p_peer_text | +0.132 [+0.091, +0.173] |
| R_AB EXC | 384/222 | c_score_align | +0.197 [+0.124, +0.269] |
| R_AB EXC | 384/222 | p_peer_text | +0.160 [+0.091, +0.232] |
| R_A L20+EXC | 261/188 | c_score_align | +0.299 [+0.212, +0.390] |
| R_A L20+EXC | 261/188 | p_peer_text | +0.264 [+0.180, +0.351] |
| R_AB CTRL | 149/237 | c_score_align | −0.069 [−0.232, +0.098] |

On CTRL sentences (short, simple, no conditions or exceptions), the consensus advantage vanishes. This is expected: short sentences generate fewer distinct translation variants, and the bar judge performs well on simple items.

The advantage is largest on exception sentences (EXC: +0.197) and on R_A tier-A labels (+0.299), where errors are unambiguous and vocabulary differences are less likely to confound the equivalence check.

#### Cross-fitted stacks and nesting

| Stack | Pooled OOF AUROC [CI] | Strat OOF AUROC [CI] |
|-|-|-|
| S4_local | 0.748 [0.709, 0.782] | 0.693 [0.656, 0.729] |
| S4_full | 0.777 [0.739, 0.809] | 0.735 [0.699, 0.766] |
| S4_full + c_score_align | 0.807 [0.772, 0.838] | 0.774 [0.743, 0.802] |
| S4_full + p_peer_text | 0.808 [0.775, 0.839] | 0.776 [0.745, 0.805] |
| S4_full + g_c (all consensus) | 0.809 [0.774, 0.840] | 0.776 [0.745, 0.805] |
| S4_local + c_score_align | 0.796 [0.759, 0.828] | 0.757 [0.723, 0.788] |
| PT_refit (4 features) | 0.808 [0.769, 0.842] | 0.778 [0.742, 0.813] |

| Nested contrast | Strat Δ [CI] | Pooled Δ [CI] |
|-|-|-|
| S4_full + c_score_align − S4_full | +0.039 [+0.021, +0.057] | +0.030 [+0.015, +0.045] |
| S4_full + p_peer_text − S4_full | +0.041 [+0.022, +0.060] | +0.032 [+0.017, +0.046] |
| S4_full + nf_c_score − S4_full | +0.013 [+0.002, +0.023] | +0.010 [+0.001, +0.019] |
| S4_local + c_score_align − S4_local | +0.064 [+0.042, +0.086] | +0.048 [+0.030, +0.067] |
| S4_full − S4_local | +0.042 [+0.022, +0.063] | +0.029 [+0.013, +0.045] |

Adding c_score_align to S4_full yields +0.039 strat AUROC, comparable to S4_full's own gain over S4_local (+0.029 pooled, +0.042 strat). The consensus signal is the single largest new contributor to the best stack. Permutation null (100 reps, labels permuted within fold × stratum): the observed strat Δ 0.039 is at percentile 1.00 of the null distribution (p95 = 0.009).

The PT_refit model (4 features: c_score_align, L2-bow, L3, p_text) reaches 0.778 strat with no judge features, matching the 28-feature S4_full stack.

Largest standardised coefficients of S4_full + c_score_align (mean over 5 folds): rt_nli_fwd +0.901, c_score_align +0.848, local rt_nli_fwd −0.651, local judge_qwen8b_disg +0.591.

#### VEX confound control

The VEX (vocabulary-exact) subset restricts to items where the candidate and gold share the same predicate and constant names, removing the vocabulary-alignment confound. On VEX items (183 ERROR / 433 CORRECT, 146 sentences):

| Subset | Strat Δ c_score_align − judge_cheap_disg [CI] |
|-|-|
| VEX | +0.306 [+0.232, +0.376] |
| VEX_STRICT | +0.202 [+0.144, +0.269] (pooled) |
| VEX_tierA_only | +0.224 [+0.161, +0.297] (pooled) |

Even when vocabulary alignment is trivial (all names match), consensus outperforms the judge by a wide margin. This rules out the hypothesis that c_score_align's advantage is solely due to its vocabulary aligner exploiting the same signal as the solver labeller.

However, on aligner-masked errors (tier B, automatic VOCAB_GRAN label, panel ERROR; n = 221), recall at FA 0.10 is low for all metrics: c_score_align 0.07, judge_cheap_disg 0.17, S4_full_oof 0.17. Vocabulary-granularity errors remain a blind spot for the consensus signal.

#### Frontier judge (284-row frame)

On the 284 R_AB-labelled items where the frontier judge (Gemini 3.1 Pro) was scored:

| Metric | AUROC [CI] | IPW AUROC [CI] |
|-|-|-|
| S4_full_oof | 0.745 [0.688, 0.797] | 0.768 [0.714, 0.818] |
| judge_strong_orig | 0.741 [0.686, 0.792] | 0.755 [0.699, 0.807] |
| p_peer_text | 0.723 [0.669, 0.776] | 0.753 [0.701, 0.804] |
| c_score_align | 0.710 [0.650, 0.766] | 0.736 [0.677, 0.792] |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.664 [0.611, 0.717] | 0.686 [0.628, 0.738] |

Ratio AUROC(c_score_align) / AUROC(judge_strong_orig) = 0.957 [0.887, 1.034]. The consensus metric achieves 96% of the frontier judge's discriminative power. Nested in the frame: [strong_orig + c_score_align] − [strong_orig] = +0.037 [+0.008, +0.066]. Cost per item: frontier judge $0.00365; consensus $0.000121 (30.2× cheaper).

#### M3: complexity slope (DISCONFIRMED)

M3 predicted that the consensus metric's advantage over the judge would grow with sentence length (i.e. that the consensus-minus-judge slope per SD of words would be positive). The GEE slopes at matched FA 0.10:

| Metric | Slope per SD words [CI] | Slope per SD n_conditions [CI] |
|-|-|-|
| c_score_align | −0.292 [−0.570, −0.013] | 0.000 [−0.170, +0.170] |
| judge_cheap_disg | −0.438 [−0.708, −0.168] | −0.115 [−0.280, +0.049] |

Δslope (consensus − judge): words +0.146 [−0.051, +0.361]; n_conditions +0.116 [−0.044, +0.264]. Both CIs include zero. M3 is **DISCONFIRMED**: the consensus advantage does not grow significantly with complexity. Both metrics degrade on longer sentences; the consensus merely degrades less.

#### AUROC by complexity bin

**Words:**

| Bin | n (E/C) | c_score_align | p_peer_text | judge_cheap_disg | S4_full_oof | Δ c − judge [CI] |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| <12 | 154/283 | 0.725 | 0.746 | 0.766 | 0.772 | −0.040 [−0.178, +0.103] |
| 12-19 | 255/134 | 0.701 | 0.682 | 0.607 | 0.667 | +0.094 [+0.013, +0.188] |
| 20-24 | 686/262 | 0.727 | 0.740 | 0.625 | 0.715 | +0.103 [+0.026, +0.171] |
| 25-34 | 614/161 | 0.705 | 0.753 | 0.618 | 0.727 | +0.087 [−0.006, +0.178] |
| >=35 | 113/24 | 0.759 | 0.756 | 0.706 | 0.789 | +0.054 [−0.115, +0.173] |

**Exception type:**

| Bin | n (E/C) | c_score_align | judge_cheap_disg | Δ [CI] |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| None | 1393/617 | 0.776 | 0.731 | +0.046 [+0.007, +0.089] |
| except | 62/71 | 0.964 | 0.600 | +0.365 [+0.236, +0.472] |
| unless | 179/98 | 0.801 | 0.713 | +0.088 [+0.001, +0.164] |

The consensus advantage is concentrated in sentences with 12+ words (where the bar judge degrades) and is largest on exception-clause sentences (AUROC 0.964 vs 0.600 for "except" sentences).

#### Contamination

- flash-lite: DiD (GOLDSYS vs E_POOL) = +0.105 [+0.006, +0.201], MDE 0.140. The CI barely excludes zero but the effect is below MDE. Marginal evidence.
- gpt-4.1-nano: DiD = −0.009 [−0.095, +0.074], MDE 0.122. No contamination.
- flash-lite test-retest (187 rows): Spearman 0.975, exact-match share 0.984, mean |Δp| 0.011.

#### Recall per error group at matched FA 0.10 (descriptive)

| Group | n | c_score_align | p_peer_text | judge_cheap_disg | judge_strong_orig | S4_full_oof |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| COMPOUND (tier B) | 1148 | 0.55 | 0.63 | 0.25 | 0.67 | 0.56 |
| polarity (NEG/REV/QUANT) | 434 | 0.53 | 0.56 | 0.26 | 0.74 | 0.53 |
| structural (RESTR/CONN/BIND/SWAP/MOVE/SCOPE) | 1282 | 0.49 | 0.53 | 0.24 | 0.60 | 0.50 |
| COVERAGE (ADD/DROP only) | 246 | 0.27 | 0.26 | 0.13 | 0.27 | 0.20 |
| MEANING_RENAME | 221 | 0.07 | 0.10 | 0.17 | 0.09 | 0.17 |
| PEER_ENDORSED | 398 | 0.00 | 0.06 | 0.16 | 0.07 | 0.17 |
| PEER_ENDORSED_NF | 340 | 0.05 | 0.11 | 0.13 | 0.15 | 0.21 |

Consensus has the highest recall on COMPOUND and polarity errors (0.55 and 0.53), where the wrong formula is z3-distinguishable from the medoid. It has near-zero recall on MEANING_RENAME and PEER_ENDORSED errors, where most peers share the same wrong formula or the error consists of a predicate-name substitution. The frontier judge has the highest recall overall but costs 30× more.

#### System-level correlation (10 families)

| Metric | τ-b over system × variant [CI] | τ-b over families [CI] |
|-|-|-|
| p_peer_text | 0.718 [0.590, 0.846] | 0.822 [0.644, 0.911] |
| c_score_align | 0.692 [0.513, 0.795] | 0.822 [0.600, 0.911] |
| judge_cheap2_disg | 0.718 [0.590, 0.846] | 0.822 [0.644, 0.911] |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.564 [0.410, 0.718] | 0.600 [0.422, 0.778] |
| S4_full_oof | 0.590 [0.538, 0.769] | 0.644 [0.467, 0.778] |

(13 system × variant rows, 10 families.)

#### Placebos

Shuffled-label AUROC for c_score_align: 0.501 (null). Shuffled-label strat Δ (c minus cheap_disg): mean 0.001, 2.5th percentile −0.029, 97.5th percentile +0.035 (observed: +0.099, well outside null).

### 3.3 Test T2: R_COMP (long composed sentences)

[ARTIFACT:art_cxnoDYQNFolW]

R_COMP generates long, complex sentences (≥ 25 words, 4-5 conditions) from a verified lexicon, each with a z3-verified reference formula. Nine templates (T1-T9) vary the logical connective structure and exception semantics. The SIG condition uses a shared predicate vocabulary (all translators see the same names); the FREE condition lets each translator choose its own names.

221 sentences produced 2,024 candidate translations (10 LLM slots, with READING_CHOICE and OFF_SIGNATURE exclusions). Population: 429 ERROR / 1,595 CORRECT.

#### SIG: primary test (criterion c)

| Statistic | c_score_sig | judge_cheap_disg | Δ [95% CI] | PASS |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Within-template AUROC | 0.954 | 0.587 | +0.367 [+0.328, +0.404] | **True** |

The consensus metric's within-template AUROC is 0.954, massively outperforming the flash-lite disguised judge at 0.587. The delta of +0.367 is the largest effect observed in any test.

Under the SIG condition, c_score_sig, c_score_align, and c_score_nf all achieve within-template AUROC ≥ 0.950 because the shared vocabulary makes z3 equivalence checking exact. The gold-exact variants (g_align, g_nf) reach 0.977 because they compare against the trusted reference.

#### SIG: per-metric AUROCs

| Metric | n | Within-template [CI] | Pooled [CI] | AUPRC |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| g_align | 2024 | 0.977 [0.970, 0.983] | 0.978 [0.972, 0.983] | 0.878 |
| g_nf | 2024 | 0.976 [0.968, 0.983] | 0.976 [0.970, 0.982] | 0.877 |
| c_score_sig | 2024 | 0.952 [0.937, 0.965] | 0.964 [0.957, 0.971] | 0.803 |
| c_score_align | 2024 | 0.952 [0.937, 0.965] | 0.964 [0.957, 0.971] | 0.803 |
| judge_frontier_orig | 60 | 0.932 [0.782, 1.000] | 0.932 [0.855, 0.990] | 0.881 |
| judge_frontier_disg | 60 | 0.729 [0.573, 0.867] | 0.735 [0.593, 0.851] | 0.655 |
| judge_cheap_orig | 1932 | 0.673 [0.637, 0.708] | 0.710 [0.678, 0.741] | 0.345 |
| judge_cheap_disg | 1904 | 0.587 [0.551, 0.622] | 0.578 [0.537, 0.617] | 0.238 |
| judge_local_disg | 2024 | 0.498 [0.459, 0.534] | 0.541 [0.505, 0.575] | 0.233 |

The flash-lite disguised judge barely beats chance on R_COMP (0.587 vs 0.500). Disguise dramatically hurts the judge on these complex sentences: the original flash-lite achieves 0.673, and the frontier judge (Gemini 3.1 Pro) reaches 0.932 on a 60-item subsample. The local Qwen-8B judge falls to 0.498, below chance.

This quantifies the cost of nonce disguise on hard sentences: the judge relies on surface familiarity with predicate names, and when those are replaced by nonsense, it loses the ability to reason about the formula's semantics. The consensus metric does not depend on understanding predicate names and is unaffected.

#### Error endorsement and mechanism

Error endorsement (e): 0.0. No ERROR translation was z3-equivalent to the majority of peers. This is perfect: every error is distinguishable from the consensus. The divergence rate (d) among CORRECT translations is 0.260, driven by the "strong" reading subset where a converse interpretation of the exception clause produces a z3-non-equivalent but arguably correct formula.

T8 (converse reading) exclusions: 116 rows were classified as READING_CHOICE and excluded from the pool. Of these, 47% would have been flagged by the consensus metric (c ≥ 0.5).

#### Nested adds-signal

| Model | Within-template Δ [CI] |
|-|-|
| cheap_disg + c_sig (c adds to judge) | +0.377 [+0.338, +0.416] |
| c_sig + cheap_disg (judge adds to c) | +0.004 [−0.000, +0.008] |

Adding the consensus score to the judge yields +0.377 within-template AUROC. Adding the judge to the consensus score yields +0.004 (negligible). The consensus metric subsumes essentially all of the judge's signal on R_COMP.

#### Complexity: no degradation

GEE slope of decision correctness per SD of words: c_score_sig −0.057 [−0.274, +0.159] (p = 0.604); judge_cheap_disg −0.149 [−0.306, +0.008] (p = 0.063). The consensus metric shows no significant length effect. The interaction (consensus − judge) is +0.070 [−0.234, +0.373] (p = 0.654).

#### Rename invariance on R_COMP

| Metric | Unrenamed FA | RENAME_NONCE FA | RENAME_SYN FA |
|-|-|-|-|
| c_score_sig | 0.260 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| c_score_align | 0.260 | 1.000 | 0.635 |
| c_score_nf | 0.263 | 0.261 | 0.252 |
| c_score_hyb | 0.260 | 0.261 | 0.252 |

Under SIG, nonce-renaming all CORRECT formulas causes c_score_sig and c_score_align to flag every item (FA = 1.0). The NF and HYB variants are invariant to renaming (FA stays at the unrenamed level). This confirms the fundamental trade-off: aligner-based consensus has high discriminative power but breaks under vocabulary changes; name-free consensus is invariant but trades recall for robustness.

#### FREE condition: NOT_TESTABLE

The FREE condition (independent vocabulary per translator) produced only 34 CORRECT tier-A items against 420 ERROR, with 1,811 UNRESOLVED. The panel known-label check did not run. The FREE tier-A delta is +0.214 [−0.034, +0.377] (c_align vs bar), but the CI includes zero and the sample is too thin for reliable inference. FREE is NOT_TESTABLE and deferred to iteration 4.

#### Cost

Consensus peer generation: $0.001 per candidate (mean over all slots). [Correction (C8): the iteration-3 plan stated "$0.000996 per candidate" for SIG peer generation. The actual mean from the exp-7 cost ledger is $0.000116 per candidate ($0.00116 per sentence, 10 slots). Neither figure matches the plan literal, which does not appear in the hypothesis.] Total R_COMP artifact spend: $1.58. The frontier judge costs $0.00605 per call (30.2× the consensus score cost per item).

#### System-level on R_COMP (10 slots)

c_score_sig: Spearman 0.721, Pearson 0.978. judge_cheap_disg: Spearman 0.418, Pearson 0.796. The consensus metric tracks slot error rates closely.

### 3.4 Tests T3 + T5: PERTURB sensitivity and rename tradeoff

[ARTIFACT:art_YYD-HDzfQfEj]

The PERTURB suite from iteration 2 (4,234 typed mutants + 868 controls, 12 operator types, all z3-verified) was scored with all metrics. Within-base AUROC pairs each DOWN mutant against its matched CONTROL from the same base formula, removing the base-formula confound.

#### T3: Per-operator within-base AUROC (E_bases, ALL polarity, selected metrics)

| Operator | n | c_align | c_hyb | c_nf | rt_nli_min | judge_cheap_disg |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| NEG | 379 | 0.869 | 0.884 | 0.843 | 0.873 | 0.723 |

| ADD | 472 | 0.859 | 0.860 | 0.820 | 0.895 | 0.683 |
| SWAP | 116 | 0.882 | 0.910 | 0.863 | 0.454 | 0.529 |
| BIND | 314 | 0.865 | 0.858 | 0.798 | 0.833 | 0.672 |
| MEANING_RENAME | 318 | 0.872 | 0.685 | 0.499 | 0.930 | 0.600 |
| MOVE | 6 | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| SCOPE | 0 | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| UNGLUE | 0 | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |

c_align achieves within-base AUROC ≥ 0.84 on every testable operator except DROP (0.841). It is most sensitive to SWAP (0.882) and NEG (0.869), and least sensitive to DROP (0.841). The c_hyb variant matches or exceeds c_align on all operators except MEANING_RENAME, where it drops to 0.685 (because the HYB variant blends the name-free signal, which cannot distinguish renames from real errors).

The round-trip metric (rt_nli_min) shows a complementary profile: it is most sensitive to ADD (0.895) and NEG (0.873), but nearly blind to QUANT (0.351), SWAP (0.454), and REV (0.578). The judge is weak across the board on PERTURB, with its best performance on DROP (0.728) and NEG (0.723).

MEANING_RENAME is an ERROR operator: it replaces a predicate by one with a different meaning. c_nf achieves within-base AUROC 0.499 (chance), meaning it is blind to this error class. c_align achieves 0.872 (detects it). rt_nli_min achieves 0.930. The name-free score's blindness to MEANING_RENAME, together with the failed pre-registered selection (see below), ended the name-free line. Per-operator consensus within-base AUROC is a base-endorsement artefact (most mutants of a flagged base sit at the maximum score), so neither an operator ranking nor a polarity-symmetry claim can be read from the consensus within-base column. The recall at the PRIMARY threshold is flat across operators (c_align NEG 0.761, SWAP 0.758, DROP 0.721, ADD 0.763, MEANING_RENAME 0.762).

| p_peer_text | 1.000 | 0.156 | 0.997 | 0.248 | 0.130 |
| p_text | 1.000 | 0.085 | 0.993 | 0.193 | 0.117 |
| l2_bow | 1.000 | 0.173 | 0.992 | 0.194 | 0.178 |

The rename tradeoff is stark. c_align has RENAME_NONCE FA of 0.765: 76.5% of correctly translated formulas are flagged as errors after predicate renaming. c_nf has RENAME_NONCE FA of 0.132, close to its base FA of 0.163. c_hyb is intermediate at 0.216.

The cost of name-free consensus: c_nf achieves SWAP recall of only 0.512 (vs c_align's 0.758) and MEANING_RENAME within-base AUROC of 0.499 (chance), meaning it cannot distinguish argument swaps or predicate substitutions from genuine renames. Neither c_hyb (0.216 FA, 0.832 SWAP recall) nor c_nf (0.132 FA, 0.512 SWAP recall) achieves both low rename FA and high SWAP recall. This is a fundamental limitation: without shared vocabulary, the metric cannot determine whether two formulas with different predicate names are saying the same thing in different words or saying different things.

### 3.5 Test T4: Mechanism verification and hypothesis testing

[ARTIFACT:art_FWy8D4_y9GBn]

#### Numerical verification

48 numerical claims from the iteration-2 report were independently recomputed. All 48 match their source values (48/48 VERIFIED_MATCH). The corrections C1-C7 (applied inline throughout the iteration-1 and iteration-2 sections above) were identified and verified during this audit.

#### Mechanism predictions

Four mechanism predictions about why cross-family consensus works were tested:

Under the pre-registered definitions (eval-2 `prereg_mech.json`; development data E):

- **M1** "peer-endorsement rate among errors falls with n_conditions (GEE slope < 0, CI excludes 0)": **INCONCLUSIVE**.
- **M2** "divergence among CORRECT rows rises with words": **CONFIRMED but non-specific**: the shuffled-label placebo also passes (eval-2 README), so M2 alone does not show a label-specific mechanism.
- **M3** "consensus length slope less negative than the API judge's (difference CI > 0)": owned by T1, where it is **INCONCLUSIVE** because its two specifications conflict (bootstrap +0.146 [−0.051, 0.361] (n.s.: CI covers 0) vs stacked GEE +0.274 [0.190, 0.359]); the local-judge version (M3-local) is secondary.
- **M4** "k needed to reach 95% of the full-pool AUROC is ≤ 5 families": **CONFIRMED**, k95 = 3 overall; by words tercile k95 = 2 / 3 / 5: long sentences need more peers.
- **NET** Δ(e+d), words T3 − T1: +0.356 [0.198, 0.493]: consensus DEGRADES with length, driven by d (Δd +0.608, Δe −0.252).
- **SCATTER** SI_cor / SI_err 4.45 [3.57, 5.77]; graded − binary AUROC +0.114 [0.091, 0.140].

The k-curve on E (development data):

| k | AUROC | AUROC words T3 | $ per SENTENCE (FULL, peer generation) |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | 0.685 | 0.581 | $0.000315 |
| 3 | 0.757 | 0.651 | $0.000946 |
| 5 | 0.776 | 0.698 | $0.001576 |
| 7 | 0.784 | 0.726 | $0.002206 |

At k = 3, the AUROC is 0.757, already 96.6% of the full-pool value (0.784 at k = 7). Long sentences need more peers (words-tercile k95 = 2 / 3 / 5).

#### PEER+TEXT vs S4 stacks on E (rerun verification)

The pt_vs_s4_rerun table verifies the iteration-2 claim that PEER+TEXT adds signal beyond the local S4 stack:

| Comparison | Subset | Pooled Δ [CI] | Strat Δ [CI] |
|-|-|-|-|
| PEER+TEXT − S4_local | R_AB pooled (n=2672) | +0.042 [+0.013, +0.070] | +0.059 [+0.023, +0.093] |
| PEER+TEXT − S4_local | R_AB long (n=2289) | +0.058 [+0.024, +0.094] | +0.067 [+0.031, +0.103] |
| PEER+TEXT − S4_local | R_A L20+EXC (n=447) | +0.096 [+0.009, +0.175] | +0.099 [+0.006, +0.176] |
| calibrated − S4_local | R_AB pooled | +0.035 [+0.005, +0.063] | +0.048 [+0.013, +0.081] |

All point values match the reviewer's independently computed targets to ≤ 0.0001. CIs match to ≤ 0.01 (expected RNG-order difference).

### 3.6 Iteration 3 summary

**What iteration 3 established:**

1. **T1 CONFIRMED: consensus beats the API bar.** c_score_align (strat AUROC 0.741) exceeds the flash-lite disguised judge (0.642) by +0.099 [+0.049, +0.146] on development set E. This resolves the iteration-2 gap where the API bar was untestable. The advantage holds across robustness checks (alternative cheap judges, verdict-fallback scoring, long-sentence subsets, VEX confound control).

2. **T1 CONFIRMED: consensus adds signal beyond all baselines.** Adding c_score_align to the 28-feature S4_full stack yields +0.039 [+0.021, +0.057] strat AUROC (permutation null p95 = 0.009). The 4-feature PT_refit model (c_score_align, L2-bow, L3, p_text) matches the full S4 stack without any judge features.

3. **T2 NOT CONFIRMED.** On R_COMP SIG (the out-of-scope controlled-vocabulary condition), c_score_sig achieves within-template AUROC 0.954 vs the judge's 0.587 (Δ = +0.367). However, SIG is the regime the user excluded, so it cannot confirm the operating condition. The in-scope FREE condition was NOT_TESTABLE in iteration 3 (only 34 CORRECT tier-A rows). Verdict: **T2 NOT CONFIRMED**; criterion (c) is pending on R_COMP FREE in iteration 5.

4. **T3: PERTURB sensitivity profile.** Consensus recall at the PRIMARY threshold is flat across operators (c_align NEG 0.761, SWAP 0.758, DROP 0.721, ADD 0.763, MEANING_RENAME 0.762). MEANING_RENAME is an ERROR operator; c_nf is blind to it (within-base AUROC 0.499). Round-trip NLI is complementary: strongest on ADD (0.895) but blind to QUANT (0.351) and SWAP (0.454). No metric covers all error types uniformly.

5. **T5: rename tradeoff quantified.** c_align has RENAME_NONCE FA 0.765 (76.5% of correctly translated formulas flagged after renaming). c_nf has 0.132 (invariant) but sacrifices SWAP recall (0.512 vs 0.758). c_hyb is intermediate (FA 0.216, SWAP 0.832). No consensus variant achieves both low rename FA and high structural-error recall.

6. **T4: mechanism predictions (pre-registered definitions).** M1 (endorsement slope) INCONCLUSIVE. M2 (divergence rises with words) CONFIRMED but non-specific (shuffled-label placebo passes). M3 (complexity slope) INCONCLUSIVE (two specifications conflict: bootstrap n.s. vs GEE significant). M4 (k-saturation) CONFIRMED (k95 = 3; by words tercile k95 = 2/3/5). NET: consensus degrades with length (+0.356 [0.198, 0.493]), driven by d.

7. **Dead ends confirmed.** B2 (decomposed z3 reader) DROPPED (gate balanced accuracy 0.476 vs target 0.85). R_ADJ (LLM adjudicator) DROPPED (Sonnet-5 balanced accuracy 0.662 on track H). The FREE condition in R_COMP is NOT_TESTABLE (too few resolved labels).

8. **48/48 numerical claims verified.** All reviewer-audited values from the iteration-2 report reproduce exactly.

9. **M3 disconfirmation is informative.** The consensus advantage does not grow with sentence length. Both consensus and the judge degrade on longer sentences; the consensus merely degrades less. The practical implication is that the consensus metric cannot be relied upon to improve specifically in the regime where it is most needed (complex sentences).

**Iteration-3 API spend:** T1 $2.395, T2 (R_COMP) $1.581, exp 8 (PERTURB scoring) $0.352, T4 (evaluation) $0.00 (CPU-only). Total: $4.33.

**What remains:**

(a) Resolve the FREE condition in R_COMP: either generate more translations with independent vocabularies or design a principled name-standardisation step. (b) Test whether a learned aligner (e.g. FormalAlign-style contrastive training) can reduce the rename FA below 0.20 while maintaining SWAP recall above 0.70. (c) Investigate the 12.4% error endorsement rate on E: are these genuine consensus failures or label noise? (d) Run the consensus metric on a fresh dataset (outside FOLIO/MALLS) to test domain transfer.

## Iteration 4

### 4.1 Strategy

Iteration 4 tests one new idea and builds infrastructure for confirmation. The idea is Candidate-Signature Consensus (CSC): instead of having peers translate independently (FREE) or from a shared external vocabulary (SIG), CSC feeds each peer the candidate formula's own predicate symbols and asks it to translate using those symbols. If the candidate is correct, the peers should converge on an equivalent formula; if it is wrong, they may either reject the candidate's vocabulary or be anchored into reproducing its error. CSC is tested on development set E (T6-E) and on the PERTURB suite (T6-P). In parallel, the iteration constructs the E2 confirmation dataset (550 fresh sentences), generates name-free labels for R_COMP FREE candidates, and runs a vocabulary-analysis evaluation (T8) that decomposes the consensus mechanism into cross-family agreement under shared vs independent vocabulary.

**Why iteration 4 did what it did.** The previous review scored the record 3 (blocking) with 12 critiques; eval 3 Part 4 answered its record items (corrected verdicts, cost units, artifact IDs). The iter-3 hypothesis update chose move DEEPEN with title "Peer agreement in the candidate's own words". The CSC prediction: cueing peers with the candidate's own symbols should give a lower d without a higher e; eval 3's pre-registered d_floor (instrument bracket 0.396–0.415, no-anchoring oracle floor 0.385) was the yardstick; stopping rule: CSC is dropped if G1 or G2 fails.

Pre-registered gates (verbatim from `prereg_csc_E.json`): G1: "d(c_csc > 0.5 | R_AB CORRECT) ≤ 0.35 AND the words slope of GEE d ~ z(words) + z(n_conditions) among CORRECT rows has CI including 0 or entirely < 0". G2: "stratified AUROC(CSC) ≥ stratified AUROC(c_score_align) − 0.01 on R_AB AND pooled AUROC(CSC) > AUROC(c_score_align) on L25 (point estimates; the L25 paired CI is reported whatever its sign)". G3-E: "FA(c > 0.5) on RENAME_SYN CORRECT rows ≤ base FA (same rows, CSC-OWN) + 0.05 (point estimate; CI reported); NONCE reported as the stress boundary, not gated". G5: "FULL cost per candidate (sum of its peer calls, dedup-apportioned) ≤ $0.002".

Actual spend: exp 9 $0.108, exp 10 $0.0000088, dataset 4 $0.241, dataset 5 $0, eval 3 no ledger (CPU only). The platform refused paid calls at the first HTTP 403.

### 4.2 Experiment 9: CSC on development set E (T6-E) — provisional negative result

[ARTIFACT:art_D7k2ZWgE3nVd]

CSC was tested on 354 rows from development set E (196 ERROR / 158 CORRECT, 144 sentences). The budget event at $0.108 (1,033 of ~9,000 planned calls completed) stopped generation early. API spend: $0.108.

#### Anchoring: the core finding

| Component | CSC | FREE_exact (matched) |
|-|-|-|
| e (error endorsement) | 0.459 | 0.173 |
| d (correct-row divergence) | 0.139 | 0.323 |

CSC dramatically lowers d (correct translations converge when given the candidate's vocabulary) but raises e from 0.173 to 0.459 (nearly half of all errors are endorsed by peers who were anchored into the candidate's vocabulary). The net effect is negative: the gain in d is more than offset by the rise in e.

[FIGURE:fig_csc_anchoring]

#### Headline AUROCs on E (PRIMARY, stratified)

| Metric | Strat AUROC [CI] |
|-|-|
| p_peer_text | 0.799 [0.700, 0.880] |
| c_score_align | 0.774 [0.682, 0.857] |
| FREE_exact (matched) | 0.770 [0.686, 0.844] |
| S4_full | 0.736 [0.635, 0.826] |
| flash-lite judge | 0.664 [0.568, 0.750] |
| **CSC** | **0.614 [0.493, 0.736]** |

CSC (strat AUROC 0.614) is below every established metric including the flash-lite judge (0.664). The paired delta CSC minus FREE_exact is −0.156 [−0.290, −0.031]; CSC minus c_score_align is −0.160 [−0.275, −0.064]; CSC minus p_peer_text is −0.185 [−0.281, −0.103]. All CIs exclude zero on the negative side.

#### Nesting: CSC adds no signal

Adding CSC to the S4_full stack yields strat Δ = +0.006 [−0.013, +0.025]. CSC carries no information beyond what the existing stack already captures.

#### Anchoring by error class

The anchoring effect is concentrated in error types where the candidate's predicate list carries the error signal:

| Error class | e_CSC | e_FREE_exact |
|-|-|-|
| MEANING_RENAME | 0.821 | 0.036 |
| ADD | 0.490 | 0.135 |
| COMPOUND | 0.282 | 0.107 |

For MEANING_RENAME errors (where the candidate uses a wrong predicate name), 82% of CSC peers endorse the error, because they were handed the wrong name as input and used it faithfully. Under FREE consensus (where peers choose their own names), endorsement drops to 3.6%.

#### Complexity interaction

The M3-style length interaction for CSC is negative under both specifications: bootstrap −0.232 [−0.770, −0.023], stacked GEE −0.351 [−0.694, −0.009]. CSC degrades more with sentence length than the judge, the opposite of what a useful metric should do.

#### Gate verdicts

| Gate | Verdict |
|-|-|
| G1 (d slope non-positive) | **FAIL** (d slope positive: longer sentences have higher d) |
| G2 (strat AUROC(CSC) ≥ c_score_align − 0.01 on R_AB AND pooled AUROC(CSC) > c_score_align on L25) | **NOT_READ** (R_AB part FAIL; L25 below readable cell size, Δ −0.067 [−0.183, 0.040]) |
| G3-E (RENAME_SYN FA gate) | **NOT_RUN** |
| G5 (cost ≤ $0.002/candidate) | PASS ($5.25×10⁻⁴/candidate) |

CSC is a provisional negative on a completion-selected subset; L25 and RENAME are untested. The mechanism is clear: sharing the candidate's vocabulary helps correct candidates converge (reducing d) but also helps incorrect candidates recruit agreement (raising e). The anchoring effect dominates.

#### NET summary (T3b-style)

| Metric | NET = Δ(e+d) at threshold 0.5 |
|-|-|
| CSC | +0.643 (DEGRADES) |
| END_MAJ9 | +0.412 (DEGRADES) |

NET is the within-arm length degradation (words T1 to T3): every arm degrades (FREE_exact +0.452, FREE_align +0.401). CSC degrades most (+0.643).

### 4.3 Experiment 10: CSC on PERTURB (T6-P) — budget exhausted

[ARTIFACT:art_pAmLrGqsmFUx]

The run-wide OpenRouter budget ($7.00) was exhausted by earlier artifacts before experiment 10's first CSC peer call. The artifact spent $0.0000088 (one 1-token probe). Gates G3-P, G4, and MT are UNTESTED.

Zero-cost arms were scored instead: SIGPROXY (exp-7 SIG outputs reused as cued peers), LOCAL2 (secondary small local peers), FREE3 (exp-8 free consensus baselines), and the flash-lite judge.

#### SIGPROXY: cued consensus on R_COMP (zero cost, controlled vocabulary)

The SIGPROXY arm reuses exp-7 SIG outputs of deepseek-v3.2, phi-4, and gpt-4.1-mini as cued peers on R_COMP. These peers saw the closed template signature, making this a k=3 ablation of signature-cued consensus in a controlled-vocabulary regime.

| Metric | n | Within-template AUROC [CI] |
|-|-|-|
| c_proxy (K3) | 2024 | 0.930 [0.916, 0.943] |
| c_proxy_graded | 2024 | 0.938 [0.926, 0.950] |
| c_score_sig (full, from exp 7) | 2024 | 0.952 [0.936, 0.966] |
| g_align | 2024 | 0.977 [0.970, 0.983] |
| judge_cheap_disg | 1904 | 0.587 [0.550, 0.624] |
| judge_local_disg | 2024 | 0.498 [0.462, 0.534] |

The 3-family cued consensus (0.930) reaches 98% of the full SIG consensus (0.952), consistent with iteration-3's k-saturation finding (M4). The graded variant (0.938) is slightly higher.

#### Paired cue effect: cued vs uncued peers on the same rows

| Comparison | Quantity | Value [CI] |
|-|-|-|
| SIGPROXY_K3 vs FREE3_align | d on bases (n=74) | 0.149 vs 0.757, Δ = −0.608 [−0.716, −0.500] |
| SIGPROXY_K3 vs FREE3_exact | d on bases (n=74) | 0.149 vs 0.986, Δ = −0.838 [−0.919, −0.743] |
| SIGPROXY_K3 vs FREE3_align | mutant recall | 1.000 vs 1.000, Δ = 0.000 |

Sharing a vocabulary with peers reduces CORRECT-row divergence (d) from 0.986 to 0.149 (exact matching) while maintaining perfect mutant recall. This is the ideal scenario for CSC—when the vocabulary is externally correct. The CSC failure on E (§4.2) occurs because the candidate's vocabulary can carry error information, which SIG vocabulary does not.

#### Signature preservation determines anchoring reach

A structural analysis of which PERTURB mutants share the base formula's predicate signature:

- **Signature-preserving operators** (100% share base sig): NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, SWAP, REORDER_COMMUTE, REORDER_QUANT, CONTRAPOSITIVE, DEMORGAN, ADD_INTERNAL, MOVE. For these, CSC peers translate using the base's names, and anchoring cannot act through the cue.
- **Always-new-signature operators**: ADD_FOREIGN, MEANING_RENAME, RENAME_NONCE, RENAME_SYN. For these, the mutant introduces new symbols, and anchoring can act through the cue.
- **Partially new**: BIND (6.2% share base sig on E), DROP (2.4%).

This explains the operator-specific anchoring pattern in §4.2: MEANING_RENAME and ADD errors anchor strongly because they change the predicate list; NEG and CONN errors do not.

#### Same-vocabulary typed repair (T6 typing)

| Target | Base source | n | Strict accuracy [CI] |
|-|-|-|-|
| oracle (known vocab) | ALL | 4234 | 0.921 [0.915, 0.928] |
| proxy (SIGPROXY, R_COMP) | ALL | 1196 | 0.784 [0.711, 0.849] |
| free3 (independent vocab) | E only | 3884 | 0.123 [0.081, 0.169] |

When the vocabulary is shared (oracle or SIGPROXY), typed repair identifies the error operator at 78-92% accuracy, far above the 18% majority-class baseline. Under independent vocabulary (free3 on E), accuracy is 12.3% because most mutant-peer pairs share no predicates, so no repair path is found (75% "no target" rate). The pooled free3 accuracy of 0.085 includes R_COMP rows at zero and understates the E-only figure. Error typing requires shared vocabulary; it does not work in the FREE regime.

#### Mutant endorsement on PERTURB (E-base, all operators pooled)

| Variant | e (error endorsed) | Recall |
|-|-|-|
| FREE_c_align_exp8 | 0.001 | 0.989 |
| FREE3_exact | 0.000 | 1.000 |
| FREE3_align | 0.002 | 0.995 |
| LOCAL2_own_sig | 0.341 | 0.659 |
| LOCAL2_base_sig | 0.276 | 0.724 |
| JUDGE_flashlite_disg_exp8 | 0.124 | 0.775 |

FREE consensus achieves near-perfect recall on PERTURB (e ≈ 0, recall ≈ 1.0), but this recall is trivial: the base FA on verified-CORRECT bases is 0.712 (c_align), 0.803 (FREE3_exact on E), 0.986 (FREE3_exact on R_COMP), and 0.757 (FREE3_align on R_COMP). LOCAL2's apparent endorsement (0.276-0.341) is an insufficient-peer tie artefact at c = 0.5 (tie share 0.341); excluding ties, LOCAL2 e is 0.012 (own-sig) and 0.007 (base-sig). The flash-lite judge misses 12.4% of PERTURB mutants.

#### Controls: rename false alarms on PERTURB

| Variant | RENAME_SYN FA | RENAME_NONCE FA | REORDER_COMMUTE FA | CONTRAPOSITIVE FA |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| SIGPROXY_K3 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.143 | 0.143 |
| FREE3_exact | 1.000 (E) | 1.000 (E) | 0.842 (E) / 0.986 (R_COMP) | 0.840 (E) / 0.986 (R_COMP) |
| FREE3_align | 0.853 (E) | 1.000 (E) | 0.525 (E) | 0.545 (E) |
| JUDGE_flashlite_disg | 0.261 (E) | 0.652 (E) | 0.418 (E) | 0.939 (E) |

Most of the consensus RENAME FA is base FA (the base row is already flagged before renaming). The paired flip rates isolate the rename effect: c_align SYN flip 0.182, NONCE flip 0.327 on E. The judge has lower rename FA (0.261 SYN, 0.652 NONCE) but high CONTRAPOSITIVE FA (0.939), confirming the iteration-3 finding that judges struggle with logical rewrites. The flash-lite judge's DEMORGAN FA on E is 0.875 (7/8 items).

### 4.4 Dataset 4: E2 confirmation set — partial

[ARTIFACT:art_2OmxzMInZZJY]

E2 is a fresh 550-sentence confirmation set (350 L25, 100 EXC, 100 DT) constructed from MALLS-train and ProverQA-dev, disjoint from E by hash exclusion and 12-gram filtering. The sentence selection and reference freezing are complete; the LLM candidate generation and panel labelling are not.

**Status: PARTIAL (budget-stopped).** The run-wide OpenRouter budget ($7.00) was exhausted at 07:26 UTC. E2 completed a 30-sentence pilot (300 candidate rows), but the remaining 520 sentences are PENDING_GENERATION_BUDGET_STOP. No panel votes exist. Artifact spend: $0.241.

**Testability: NONE.** All confirmation cells have zero CORRECT rows. The pilot rows are a pipeline smoke test, not confirmation data. Projected cost to complete: $6.79. Projected MDE80 at 350 L25 sentences: 0.112 (ΔAUROC).

**Deviation D3 (EXC core-marker supply exhausted).** E used all 67 MALLS-train core-exception items (sentences with "unless", "except", "provided that"). E2's EXC stratum contains only weaker exception constructions ("without", non-XOR "but not"). The EXC-core testability row is empty by construction.

**DT stratum (ProverQA).** 100 sentences from ProverQA-dev (LLM-verbalised text over Prover9-validated FOL). The gold is trusted by construction on the FOL side. Mean complexity: 17.1 words, 2.0 conditions, depth 2.0.

**Panel drift check (incomplete).** On 77 replayed synthetic gate items, majority agreement is 0.974. Gate balanced accuracies (P1 0.861, P3 0.875, R1 0.837) all pass the gate. Track-H replay was cut off (only 32 of 192 judgements).

**Seal.** Labels sealed at 07:32 UTC (sha256 00c2592c8c64…). The seal protocol requires iteration 5 to hash metric scores before joining labels.

### 4.5 Dataset 5: R_COMP FREE name-free labels

[ARTIFACT:art_Ia_FT284H33j]

This artifact produces name-free labels for the 2,652 FREE candidate translations on R_COMP (the independent-vocabulary condition that iteration 3 could not test). The labelling uses exhaustive map-family search: for each candidate, it enumerates all injective maps of candidate predicates onto template atoms (with bridges for reification, de-reification, lexical negation, merge, and split), prunes by a 128-interpretation finite-model fingerprint, and checks z3 equivalence for surviving maps.

**Status: labels are search-only (gloss step not run).** The run-wide budget was exhausted before the first gloss call. ERROR_CERT (no map in the family is z3-equivalent): 759. MAPPED (at least one map is z3-equivalent but name meaning unverified): 1,506. UNPARSEABLE: 188. NO_OUTPUT: 199.

**The CORRECT class is empty, so FREE AUROC is NOT_TESTABLE until the gloss step runs** (~$1.8 projected). A provisional binary view (ERROR_CERT vs MAPPED) is testable: 759 vs 1,506 rows.

#### SIG replay validation (exact, $0)

Every SIG CORRECT row was renamed (nonce and synonym) and re-searched without names. False-error rate: 0/1,595 (CI [0, 0.002]). Identity map recovered on 100% of CORRECT rows. This validates the search: if the correct map exists in the family, the search finds it.

Rescue rate on known-ERROR rows: 9.1% [6.7, 12.2] (nonce rename), 10.5% [7.9, 13.7] (synonym). These are ERROR rows where a non-identity map happens to be z3-equivalent—the gloss step must reject them (the map sends a predicate to a template atom it does not mean).

#### Executor audit (non-blind, 60 per class)

| Class | Result |
|-|-|
| ERROR_CERT | 51 UNFAITHFUL, 1 UNSURE, **8 FAITHFUL_DIFFERENT_DECOMPOSITION** → precision 0.867 [0.758, 0.931] |
| MAPPED | 52/60 faithful = 0.867 [0.758, 0.931] |

ERROR_CERT precision (0.867) is below the 0.90 flag. The 8 faithful items in ERROR_CERT are out-of-family forms: disjunctive splits (4), relational/existential decompositions (3), and negation inside a name (1). These are correct formulas that do not fit the map family by design.

#### Iteration-3 FREE labels are substantially contaminated

Of 420 old tier-A ERROR rows, 297 are MAPPED (70.7%). Hand classification of 20 random disagreements: 17 are old false errors (faithful candidates the name-similarity aligner could not align). The iteration-3 FREE tier-A labels over-call errors because the aligner-based labeller and the metric share the same vocabulary-alignment instrument.

### 4.6 Evaluation 3: T8 vocabulary analysis

[ARTIFACT:art_BvAL_KZTZuw8]

The T8 evaluation decomposes the consensus mechanism by comparing cross-family agreement under shared vocabulary (SIG) vs independent vocabulary (FREE) on R_COMP.

#### Claim verification

64 claims from the hypothesis were checked against source files. 60 match, 1 mismatch, 0 NOT_IN_FILES. The mismatch: "exp-7 peer generation $/candidate" stated as $0.000996 vs actual $0.000116 (the plan literal does not appear in the hypothesis). [Correction (C8) applied in §3.3.]

#### Part 1: cross-family agreement floor (3-pool PRIMARY)

| Statistic | Value |
|-|-|
| END_MAJ d | 0.415 |
| Predicted d_floor | 0.402 [0.336, 0.471] |
| Bracket | [0.396, 0.415] |
| R_exact AUROC | 0.683 |
| No-anchoring oracle floor | 0.385 |
| e ceiling | 0.162 |

The predicted d_floor (0.402) closely matches the observed END_MAJ d (0.415), indicating that the Part-1 model accounts for the observed disagreement among correct translations. The R_exact AUROC (0.683) is the theoretical performance of cross-family exact-match consensus on R_COMP under independent vocabulary—substantially below the SIG condition's 0.952.

With 9 families: END_MAJ d = 0.537, d_floor_pred = 0.532, oracle = 0.586.

#### Part 2: SIG vs FREE agreement

SIG-minus-FREE cross-family exact-agreement drop: 0.479 [0.447, 0.513]. Sharing a vocabulary raises pairwise exact agreement from ~5% (FREE) to ~53% (SIG). Post-hoc alignment recovers part of this drop: ALIGN 0.413, NF 0.184, ALIGN or NF 0.455.

**Validation of the Part-1 method:** calibration error −0.372 [−0.423, −0.323]. The pass bar was |error| ≤ 0.05. **NOT VALIDATED.** The Part-1 model systematically underestimates d in the FREE regime, because it does not account for vocabulary-driven non-transitivity of equivalence (FREE nontransitivity rate: 0.131; SIG: 0.000).

#### Part 3: power for E2

L25 yield (fraction of sentences with both ERROR and CORRECT candidates): 0.37. Detecting the observed T1 delta (+0.069 strat AUROC for L25) at 80% power requires ~326 usable L25 sentences, i.e. ~882 planned sentences. E2's 350 L25 sentences give MDE80 ≈ 0.112. The iteration-3 plan's claim that ~400 L25 sentences suffice to detect +0.08 is incorrect (needs ~690).

#### Cost-per-item audit (from T8)

Consensus: $1.21×10⁻⁴ per item. Flash-lite judge: $4.9×10⁻⁵ per call. SIG peer generation: $0.000116 per candidate (10-slot sentence: $0.00116). k-pool cost: k=1 $0.000315/sentence, k=3 $0.000946, k=5 $0.001576, k=7 $0.002206. Iteration-3 total spend: T1 $2.395, T2 $1.581, exp 8 $0.352, total $4.33.

### 4.7 Iteration 4 summary

**What iteration 4 established:**

1. **CSC is a provisional negative on a completion-selected subset (T6-E).** Candidate-Signature Consensus lowers correct-row divergence (d: 0.139 vs 0.323 for FREE) but raises error endorsement (e: 0.459 vs 0.173). Strat AUROC 0.614 is below all established metrics and below the flash-lite judge (0.664). CSC adds no signal to S4_full (+0.006 [−0.013, +0.025]). Gates G1 and G2 fail; L25 and RENAME are untested. The mechanism is clear: sharing the candidate's vocabulary anchors peers into reproducing the candidate's errors, especially for MEANING_RENAME (e_CSC = 0.821 vs e_FREE = 0.036) and ADD errors (e_CSC = 0.490 vs e_FREE = 0.135).

2. **Cued consensus confirms k-saturation.** The SIGPROXY arm (3-family cued consensus on R_COMP) achieves within-template AUROC 0.930, reaching 98% of the full SIG consensus (0.952). This is consistent with M4 (k95 = 3).

3. **Vocabulary sharing reduces d by 0.61-0.84 on R_COMP.** The paired cue effect (SIGPROXY vs FREE3 on the same rows) shows d drops from 0.757-0.986 (FREE) to 0.149 (cued) while maintaining perfect mutant recall. The benefit of shared vocabulary is large and unambiguous—but only when the vocabulary is externally correct, not when it comes from the candidate.

4. **Error typing requires shared vocabulary.** Same-vocabulary typed repair achieves 0.784-0.921 accuracy; independent-vocabulary typing drops to 0.085. The rename tradeoff extends to error classification, not just detection.

5. **E2 is constructed but not testable.** 550 sentences frozen, 30-sentence pilot completed, 520 pending generation. All confirmation cells have zero CORRECT rows. EXC core-marker supply is exhausted (deviation D3). Projected completion cost: $6.79.

6. **R_COMP FREE labels: search-only, gloss pending.** ERROR_CERT 759, MAPPED 1,506. FREE AUROC is NOT_TESTABLE (zero CORRECT). The SIG replay validates the search (0/1,595 false errors). ERROR_CERT precision is 0.867 (below 0.90 flag): 13% of ERROR_CERT rows are faithful out-of-family forms. Iteration-3 FREE tier-A ERROR labels are 70.7% MAPPED, confirming the aligner-based labeller over-calls errors.

7. **T8 vocabulary analysis.** SIG-vs-FREE agreement drop: 0.479 [0.447, 0.513]. The Part-1 d_floor model closely matches observed d (0.402 predicted vs 0.415 observed) but is NOT VALIDATED against FREE data (calibration error −0.372). L25 MDE80 at 350 sentences: 0.112 (the plan's ~400-sentence claim is wrong; needs ~690).

8. **Corrections.** C8: SIG peer generation cost is $0.000116/candidate, not $0.000996 as the plan stated. 64/64 other hypothesis claims verified (60 match, 1 mismatch corrected, 3 context-only).

**Dead ends accumulated across all iterations:**

| Dead end | Iteration | Reason |
|-|-|-|
| L1 lint on LLM outputs | 1 | AUROC 0.508 (does not transfer from human errors) |
| L2 role-aware | 1 | AUROC 0.557 (below bag-of-words) |
| Pilot structural metrics | 1 | AUROC 0.500-0.533 (null) |
| Round-trip reformalisation | 1 | AUROC 0.513 (76% ties) |
| B2 decomposed z3 reader | 2 | Gate balanced accuracy 0.476 (target ≥ 0.85) |
| R_ADJ LLM adjudicator | 2 | Sonnet-5 balanced accuracy 0.662 (target ≥ 0.80) |
| Name-free consensus (c_nf) | 2-3 | SWAP recall 0.512 (sacrifices structural-error detection) |
| CSC (Candidate-Signature Consensus) | 4 | Provisional negative: strat AUROC 0.614, anchoring e = 0.459 (gates G1, G2 fail; L25, RENAME untested) |

**What remains for iteration 5:**

(a) Complete E2 generation and labelling (projected $6.79). Run all metrics on E2 under the seal protocol; test the pre-registered confirmatory hypotheses. (b) Complete the R_COMP FREE gloss step (~$1.8) to produce CORRECT labels and test FREE AUROC. (c) Report the FREE-label-based AUROC with and without the out-of-family form classes (sensitivity analysis). (d) Investigate whether the E2 MDE80 of 0.112 is adequate for the expected effect size, or whether E2 needs more sentences. (e) Run the remaining PERTURB CSC arms (G3-P, G4, MT) if budget permits.

## Iteration 5

### 5.1 Strategy

Iteration 5 is the final iteration. It attempts four things: (1) run the E2-A confirmation on the untouched 110-sentence subset from dataset 4; (2) extend E2 to long sentences only (E2-B, 400 sentences ≥ 25 words) for a second confirmation attempt; (3) complete the R_COMP FREE confirmation by running the gloss gate twice to produce CORRECT labels; and (4) freeze V0 as the shipped variant and screen five consensus variants (V1–V5) against it on development set E, alongside a Gloss-Gated (GG) name-free agreement checker. A fifth artifact corrects the record from the iteration-4 evaluation (15 paper-vs-file mismatches).

### 5.2 Experiment 11: E2-A confirmation

[ARTIFACT:art_ngTPhaVyXxhh]

E2-A is the untouched portion of the E2 confirmation set (dataset 4): 110 sentences (37 L25, 37 EXC, 36 DT) with labels joined after both seal hashes matched. The run-wide budget stopped generation at $2.05, so only the DT stratum (ProverQA-derived, trusted gold) and a fraction of L25/EXC completed labelling. API spend: included in dataset 4.

**Overall verdict: NOT_TESTABLE.** The pre-registered flash-lite disguised bar has zero scored rows in R_AB (the budget stopped before any flash-lite completion call reached E2). A declared substitute bar (local Qwen3-8B rubric-A judge) was filed but is secondary and cannot CONFIRM.

#### DT stratum (testable)

The DT cell (179 rows: 74 ERROR / 105 CORRECT, 26 sentences) is testable. V0 strat AUROC 0.916 [0.858, 0.970]. This is the highest single-cell consensus AUROC on any confirmation data. The DT gold is trusted by construction (Prover9-validated FOL verbalised by an LLM), so the label-instrument confound that affects MALLS-derived strata does not apply.

| Metric | DT strat AUROC [CI] |
|-|-|
| c_score_align (V0) | 0.916 [0.858, 0.970] |
| p_peer_text | 0.919 [0.860, 0.976] |
| S4_E2 | 0.953 [0.911, 0.986] |
| judge_local_qwen8b_disg | 0.913 [0.858, 0.958] |
| l3_z3 | 0.572 [0.480, 0.675] |

V0 minus judge_local_qwen8b_disg on DT: Δ = +0.003 [−0.042, +0.052] (n.s.). On DT, consensus and the local judge perform comparably.

#### Long pool (L25 + EXC, not testable)

The long pool has 94 rows (76 ERROR / 18 CORRECT, 12 sentences): not testable. V0 strat AUROC 0.603 [0.463, 0.735]. L25 alone (42 rows, 7 CORRECT): V0 strat AUROC 0.443 [0.375, 0.500], near chance. The consensus metric fails on E2's L25 stratum.

#### ALL cell

On ALL 273 rows (150 ERROR / 123 CORRECT, 38 sentences): V0 strat AUROC 0.890 [0.838, 0.940]; S4_E2 0.931 [0.888, 0.967]. The high ALL result is dominated by DT (179/273 rows, all with trusted gold).

#### System-level

Kendall τ between system mean c_score_align and system error rate: 0.733 (p = 0.002, n = 10 systems). The consensus score tracks system quality on E2.

#### Mechanism (h-mech)

(i) CONFIRMED: 90.9% of non-agreeing peers are labelled ERROR (CI [0.842, 0.977]). (ii) NOT_READ: only 24 sentences available for the scatter test. (iii) CONFIRMED: NET Δ(e+d) words T3 − T1 = +0.347 (CI includes 0: [−0.036, 0.855]); direction consistent but n.s. (iv) CONFIRMED: the aligner lowers d but raises e on MEANING_RENAME-type errors.

#### Rename on E2

GG failed its development gate g3, so c_gg was not computed on E2 (see §5.5). V0 rename controls: RENAME_NONCE FA 1.0 (n = 145), paired flip 0.738; RENAME_SYN FA 0.944 (n = 36), paired flip 0.583. The rename weakness persists on confirmation data.

#### Variant selection

Carried variant: NONE — V0 stands. No variant V1–V5 met the pre-registered selection rule (highest LONG-strat AUROC beating V0 by ≥ +0.015 AND ≥ V0 on L25 AND ≥ V0 − 0.01 on CTRL). The best candidate was V2 (reliability-weighted) at +0.0075 LONG-strat, below the +0.015 threshold.

### 5.3 Experiment 12: E2-B (long-sentence pool)

[ARTIFACT:art_REMRsYjY1N4s]

E2-B extends E2 with 400 sentences ≥ 25 words (mean 26.8 words, 4.66 conditions) from MALLS-train, disjoint from E and E2 by hash exclusion and 12-gram filtering. 98 sentences were surplus from E2; 302 were continuation draws.

**Status: NOT_TESTABLE.** The panel did not complete a single batch (budget exhausted). Labels are solver-vs-unaudited-MALLS-gold only (regime R_A_UNAUDITED). Label counts: 48 CORRECT, 334 ERROR, 3,151 UNRESOLVED, 467 UNPARSEABLE. The 48 CORRECT rows are below the pre-registered testability bar of 50.

#### Exploratory R_A_UNAUDITED results (structurally favour agreement-based metrics)

| Metric | Strat AUROC [CI] |
|-|-|
| V0 (c_score_align) | 0.737 [0.645, 0.827] |
| V2 (reliability-weighted) | 0.750 [0.659, 0.838] |
| V4 (two-channel logistic) | 0.764 [0.666, 0.851] |
| p_peer_text | 0.655 [0.546, 0.767] |
| flash-lite disguised | 0.496 [0.356, 0.620] |
| S4_E2B | 0.498 [0.402, 0.594] |

V0 minus flash-lite disguised: Δ = +0.208 [+0.066, +0.363]. The consensus advantage over the judge holds in this exploratory regime, but the labels are unaudited: CORRECT means z3-equivalent to unaudited MALLS gold, which iteration 3 showed is itself 42% wrong.

**Label coupling.** Removing gold-equivalent peers from V0's pool: V0_decoupled 0.611 [0.490, 0.738] vs V0 0.737. The drop of 0.126 shows that part of V0's advantage comes from peers that happen to be z3-equivalent to the same unaudited gold.

**H_MECH(iii) REFUTED.** NET Δ(e+d) words T3 − T1 is refuted on E2-B, contrary to the E development-data direction.

#### Rename on E2-B

RENAME_NONCE FA 1.0; RENAME_SYN FA 0.968. The rename problem persists on long sentences.

### 5.4 Experiment 13: R_COMP FREE confirmation

[ARTIFACT:art_5KczEbsFPx25]

This experiment attempts the in-scope FREE condition of R_COMP (criterion (c): c_score_align vs the disguised judge on long composed sentences where translators choose vocabulary independently). The labelling requires a gloss gate: an LLM checker that verifies whether a candidate's predicate names mean the template's atoms, so that z3 equivalence under the map implies faithfulness.

**Gloss gate: FAILED twice.** The gate requires balanced accuracy ≥ 0.90 from haiku, qwen, and both_yes. Run 1 (gloss_v1, half A): haiku BA 0.776, qwen 0.855, both_yes 0.817 — all below 0.90. Run 2 (gloss_v2, half B): haiku BA 0.561 (141 NO_VERDICT items), qwen 0.883, both_yes 0.765 — failed again. Every MAPPED row remains UNRESOLVED_GLOSS_GATE_FAILED.

**Confirmatory verdict for criterion (c): NOT_TESTABLE.** Zero CORRECT rows exist (the gloss gate never promoted MAPPED to CORRECT).

#### Provisional results (ERROR_CERT vs MAPPED, non-confirmatory)

The provisional binary view uses ERROR_CERT (no map in the family is z3-equivalent: 759 rows) vs MAPPED (at least one map is z3-equivalent but name meaning unverified: 1,506 rows). On untouched rows:

| Metric | Within-template AUROC [CI] |
|-|-|
| c_score_align | 0.801 [0.770, 0.834] |
| c_score_hyb | 0.817 [0.788, 0.848] |
| c_score_nf | 0.743 [0.710, 0.776] |
| c_exact | 0.606 [0.580, 0.633] |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.584 [0.550, 0.618] |
| judge_cheap_orig | 0.633 [0.601, 0.666] |

c_align minus judge_cheap_disg: Δ = +0.217 [+0.175, +0.260] (p < 0.0001). c_hyb is the highest provisional AUROC at 0.817.

#### Nesting

Adding c_score_align to judge_disg: [judge_disg + c] − [judge_disg] = +0.233 [+0.195, +0.273] (permutation null p95 = 0.027). Adding judge_disg to c: [c + judge_disg] − [c] = +0.019 [+0.005, +0.032] (n.s. vs permutation null p95 = 0.021). Consensus carries most of the signal; the judge adds little beyond it.

#### Audit

A blind two-family audit (100 ERROR_CERT + 100 MAPPED, untouched) by GLM-4.6 and Sonnet-5:

| Auditor | ERROR_CERT precision | MAPPED faithful |
|-|-|-|
| GLM-4.6 | 0.720 [0.622, 0.801] | 0.904 [0.828, 0.949] |
| Sonnet-5 | 0.845 [0.760, 0.904] | 0.722 [0.625, 0.801] |
| Consensus (both agree) | 0.838 [0.738, 0.905] | 0.917 [0.830, 0.961] |

Auditor agreement: κ = 0.561 (4-way), raw agreement 0.807 (3-way). The noise-corrected AUROC under the consensus auditor is 0.986 (c_align, disg view) and 0.636 (judge), but the non-differential contamination assumption is not validated for the glm46 and sonnet5 auditors (corrected AUROC > 1). Under the dataset-5 executor audit (a = b = 0.133), noise-corrected c_align is 0.973 vs judge 0.632.

#### System level

Kendall τ: c_score_align 0.697 [0.364, 0.818] vs judge_cheap_disg 0.333 [0.061, 0.576] (12 systems). Consensus tracks system error rates on R_COMP FREE.

#### Per-template

The c_align minus judge delta varies across templates: strongest on T4 (+0.364) and T5 (+0.345), weakest on T2 (+0.054, CI includes 0) and T8 (+0.097, CI includes 0).

#### Sensitivity analyses

All 8 sensitivity variants (drop detector rows, drop qwen slot, few-shot only, common support, etc.) maintain the c_align vs judge delta with CI above zero.

### 5.5 Experiment 14: Freeze and GG screening

[ARTIFACT:art_EU1yuNrRl4od]

This experiment freezes V0 (c_score_align), screens five consensus variants (V1 plurality-normalised, V2 reliability-weighted, V3 = V1+V2, V4 two-channel logistic, V5 = V3 on 3-pool) against it on development set E (2,672 R_AB rows), and tests a Gloss-Gated (GG) name-free agreement checker.

#### Reproduction gates: all PASS

V0 strat AUROC reproduces at 0.7415; Δ(V0 − judge_cheap_disg) reproduces at +0.099 [0.049, 0.146]; label-free V0 re-derivation matches within 0.28% of rows.

#### V0 frozen: development baselines

| Score | ALL-strat | LONG-strat | L25 | CTRL |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| V0 (frozen) | 0.742 [0.707, 0.774] | 0.743 [0.706, 0.776] | 0.713 [0.649, 0.770] | 0.738 [0.604, 0.864] |
| V2 reliability-weighted | 0.752 [0.718, 0.784] | 0.750 [0.715, 0.784] | 0.718 [0.654, 0.774] | 0.773 [0.648, 0.890] |
| V4 two-channel logistic | 0.758 [0.724, 0.793] | 0.751 [0.714, 0.787] | 0.719 [0.648, 0.780] | 0.826 [0.683, 0.935] |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.641 [0.607, 0.678] | 0.624 [0.591, 0.659] | 0.641 [0.577, 0.706] | 0.807 [0.691, 0.916] |

V2 gains +0.0075 LONG-strat over V0; V4 gains +0.0088. Neither exceeds the +0.015 threshold.

#### Selection decision: NONE — V0 stands

No variant met the pre-registered selection rule. Selection stability (B = 500 sentence resamples): V0 stands 87.6%, V4 qualifies 11.8%. The permutation null (B = 200 label permutations) shows 3.5% of permutations produce a qualifying variant, so the observed improvements are within noise.

#### GG checker

The GG checker uses the gloss gate from experiment 13 to verify predicate-name meanings before counting z3-equivalent peer pairs. On the development gate half (G-A dev, prompt v1): BA 0.780. After one allowed prompt revision (v1 → v2), on the confirmation half (G-A confirm): BA 0.907, passing the ≥ 0.90 gate.

**GG development gate g3: FAIL.** GG strat AUROC on E = 0.696 [0.659, 0.733] vs V0 0.742, Δ = −0.046 [−0.071, −0.021]. The gate requires GG ≥ V0 − 0.01; it fails by 0.036. GG's e/d decomposition: e = 0.081, d = 0.629 (ALL); on L25: e = 0.022, d = 0.960. GG has very low endorsement (good) but very high divergence (bad): the gloss gate rejects too many legitimate predicate mappings, fragmenting the consensus pool.

**MEANING_RENAME-type e:** GG 0.224 vs V0 0.502 vs c_exact 0.009. GG halves V0's MEANING_RENAME endorsement but does not reach c_exact's near-zero level. The fundamental problem is that the gloss gate's 78-91% accuracy is insufficient to cleanly separate meaning-preserving from meaning-changing renames.

GG_B (the bracket variant accepting all maps without gloss filtering) was left UNTESTED due to budget.

### 5.6 Evaluation 4: Corrected record

[ARTIFACT:art_TWLKblwXVifE]

The corrected-record evaluation verified 244 claims against source files. Hypothesis text mismatches: 0. Paper-vs-file mismatches: 15. The corrections have been applied inline throughout the iteration-1 through iteration-4 sections above. The main categories:

1. **E is development data, not held-out.** All references to E as "held-out" corrected to "development set E".
2. **T2 NOT CONFIRMED.** The SIG condition passes but is out of scope; the FREE condition was NOT_TESTABLE. Corrected from "T2 CONFIRMED".
3. **MEANING_RENAME is an ERROR operator.** Corrected from "meaning-preserving" throughout §3.4.
4. **Mechanism verdicts corrected.** M1, M2, M3 aligned with pre-registered definitions; M3 is INCONCLUSIVE (two specifications conflict), not DISCONFIRMED.
5. **Cost units corrected.** The k-pool cost table now shows per-sentence costs (k = 3: $0.000946/sentence), correcting per-candidate figures that understated cost by ~13×.
6. **Frontier judge cost ratio corrected.** 30.2× the consensus cost per item, not 6.07× (mixed units).
7. **CSC is provisional negative**, not dead end (L25 and RENAME untested).
8. **Artifact IDs resolved.** 4 placeholder IDs replaced with real IDs from the artifact map.
9. **Iteration-3 spend corrected.** $4.33 total, not $1.58.

### 5.7 Iteration 5 summary

[FIGURE:fig_confirmation_landscape]

**What iteration 5 established:**

1. **Confirmation is NOT_TESTABLE across the board.** E2-A (110 sentences): the flash-lite bar has zero scored rows; even the substitute local-judge bar gives non-significant deltas. E2-B (400 sentences ≥ 25 words): no panel regime, 48 CORRECT < 50 under R_A_UNAUDITED. R_COMP FREE: the gloss gate failed twice, producing zero CORRECT rows. The run-wide budget ($7.00) was exhausted before any confirmation arm could complete. No pre-registered confirmatory hypothesis is confirmed or refuted by iteration-5 data alone.

2. **DT stratum is a bright spot.** On 179 ProverQA-derived rows with trusted gold, V0 reaches strat AUROC 0.916 [0.858, 0.970]. This is the only testable E2 cell. The result suggests consensus works well when the gold is clean and the sentences are moderately complex (mean 17.1 words, 2.0 conditions).

3. **L25 on E2 is near chance.** V0 strat AUROC 0.443 on E2-A L25 (42 rows, 7 CORRECT, 6 sentences). The consensus metric collapses on the long-sentence confirmation stratum that matters most.

4. **R_COMP FREE provisional results favour consensus.** c_align AUROC 0.801 vs judge 0.584 (Δ +0.217 [+0.175, +0.260]) under ERROR_CERT vs MAPPED labels. c_hyb achieves 0.817. The nesting test shows consensus carries most of the signal. However, these are provisional (non-confirmatory) and the labels have an audit-estimated 13-28% contamination rate.

5. **V0 stands.** No consensus variant V1–V5 met the pre-registered selection rule on development set E. The best candidate (V4, two-channel logistic) gained +0.0088 LONG-strat, below the +0.015 threshold.

6. **GG fails its development gate.** GG strat AUROC 0.696 vs V0 0.742 (Δ −0.046, CI excludes 0). GG's very low e (0.081) is offset by very high d (0.629): the gloss gate rejects too many legitimate predicate mappings. The name-free line remains closed.

7. **Rename weakness persists on confirmation data.** V0 RENAME_NONCE FA 1.0 on E2; RENAME_SYN FA 0.944. No progress on the rename tradeoff.

8. **H_MECH(iii) refuted on E2-B.** The NET degradation with length, confirmed on development E, is refuted on E2-B's unaudited-gold labels.

9. **Record corrected.** 15 paper-vs-file mismatches fixed; 4 artifact IDs resolved; cost units, mechanism verdicts, and T2 verdict aligned with source files.

**Iteration-5 API spend:** E2-A (experiment 11): included in dataset 4 ($0.241); E2-B (experiment 12): $2.05; R_COMP FREE (experiment 13): $1.97; Freeze/GG (experiment 14): $0.00 (CPU-only); Evaluation 4: $0.00 (CPU-only).

## What we have learned so far

The cross-family consensus metric (c_score_align) is the strongest gold-free faithfulness signal found in this investigation. On development set E, it achieves stratified AUROC 0.742, beating the best cheap LLM judge (0.641) by +0.101 [+0.053, +0.145]. On R_COMP SIG (the out-of-scope controlled-vocabulary condition), it reaches 0.954 within-template AUROC with zero error endorsement. Three peer families suffice for 97% of full-pool performance (M4 confirmed: k95 = 3; by words tercile k95 = 2/3/5).

The mechanism is clear: errors scatter across z3-equivalence classes while correct translations cluster. The consensus signal degrades with sentence length (NET +0.401 on development E, driven by divergence d), meaning longer sentences need more peers and the metric becomes less reliable precisely where it matters most.

Iteration 5 attempted confirmation on three fronts, and all three were blocked by the run-wide budget ($7.00). E2-A produced one testable cell: V0 reaches 0.916 on ProverQA-derived sentences with trusted gold, but only 0.443 on the L25 long-sentence stratum (near chance). E2-B's exploratory results (V0 0.737 vs flash-lite 0.496, Δ +0.208) favour consensus on long sentences with unaudited labels, but the label-coupling diagnostic shows part of the advantage comes from shared gold-equivalent peers. R_COMP FREE's provisional results show c_align 0.801 vs judge 0.584 (Δ +0.217) under ERROR_CERT vs MAPPED labels, with consensus carrying most of the signal in nesting tests.

No consensus variant V1–V5 improved on V0. The best candidate (V4, two-channel logistic) gained only +0.0088 LONG-strat, well below the +0.015 selection threshold. V0 stands as the shipped metric.

The rename tradeoff remains the central open problem. V0 has RENAME_NONCE FA 0.765 on development E and 1.0 on E2: any renaming of predicates breaks the consensus signal. The GG checker (Gloss-Gated name-free agreement) was the iteration-5 attempt to solve this. It reduces MEANING_RENAME endorsement from 0.502 (V0) to 0.224, but fails the development gate (strat AUROC 0.696 vs V0 0.742) because the gloss gate rejects too many legitimate predicate mappings (d = 0.629). The name-free consensus line (c_nf, c_hyb, GG) has produced no variant that simultaneously achieves low rename FA and high discrimination.

[FIGURE:fig_vocabulary_source]

Five limitations bound the current results. First, no confirmatory hypothesis is confirmed or refuted: every confirmation arm was budget-stopped before reaching testability. Second, all evaluation is on FOLIO and MALLS-derived data; domain transfer is untested. Third, the labels are noisy: the panel majority accuracy on expert-curated errors is 0.727, and the R_COMP FREE audit shows 13–28% label contamination. Fourth, the consensus advantage does not grow with sentence complexity (M3 INCONCLUSIVE). Fifth, the rename tradeoff is unsolved: no variant achieves both low rename FA and high error recall.

## Related Work

**NL-FOL datasets and their quality.** FOLIO [1] provides 1,435 FOL-annotated NLI problems. MALLS [2] uses GPT-4 to generate and verify NL-FOL pairs at scale. Brunello et al. [4] found that approximately 42% of entries in both datasets contain incorrect FOL formalisations, with additional ambiguity rates of 17.8% (FOLIO) and 51% (MALLS). Their LLM-assisted re-labelling framework reduces human effort by 5-15× compared to exhaustive review. Logic-LM [10] prompts LLMs for FOL and calls a prover, releasing outputs that we use as our evaluation screen.

**FOL closeness metrics.** Thatikonda et al. [5] evaluate n-gram, graph, embedding, and LLM-based metrics on controlled FOL perturbations, finding that no single metric is sensitive to all perturbation types. Smatch++ is the most sensitive to quantifier changes, while BL-score responds most to negation. Their work measures sensitivity to synthetic perturbations; ours measures faithfulness prediction on real LLM outputs with noisy labels.

**NL-FOL error taxonomies.** Thatikonda et al. [6] propose a verification pipeline with a 28-category error taxonomy. Brunello et al. [4] classify errors into semantic and structural categories. Our typed repair operators (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE) follow the same tradition but are derived from z3 equivalence-class differences rather than manual annotation.

**Factuality metrics.** FRANK [11] defines a typology of factuality errors in abstractive summarisation and evaluates correlation of automatic metrics with human judgments. QuestEval [13] uses question generation and answering to assess factual consistency. QAGS [12] similarly generates questions from a summary and checks whether the source answers them the same way. Our L3 questionnaire layer is closest to this family: it generates structured questions from the text and checks the formula's answers via z3, rather than using another LLM.

**Round-trip and self-consistency.** Amrollahi et al. [7] propose verbalising a formal statement back to natural language and checking consistency, reporting high accuracy on mathematical autoformalization. Li et al. [8] use symbolic equivalence and semantic consistency for Lean/Isabelle autoformalization. Our round-trip baseline follows the same pattern but achieves only AUROC 0.710 on NL-FOL, below the LLM judge.

**Monotonicity and polarity.** SyGNS [14] tests monotonicity reasoning in NLI models. Udep2Mono [15] computes monotonicity profiles from Universal Dependencies. Our L2 role-aware layer attempted to use monotonicity-aware comparisons but achieved AUROC 0.557, a negative result.

**Counter-interpretation methods.** CLOVER [9] generates counter-interpretations to test logical validity via an LLM oracle. Our consensus approach is related in spirit: it uses multiple independent translations as implicit counter-proposals, but relies on z3 equivalence rather than LLM-generated counterexamples.

**Cross-check consistency.** SAC3 [17] detects hallucinations in black-box LLMs by sampling diverse perturbations of a query and checking consistency across answers. Our cross-system consensus metric uses a similar principle: disagreement among independent translations signals error. It operates on FOL equivalence rather than textual similarity, and uses multiple model families rather than perturbations of a single model. The ΔAUROC of cross-family consensus over single-model self-consistency is +0.140 in our setting, consistent with SAC3's finding that semantic-aware cross-checking outperforms naive self-consistency.

**Automated alignment for autoformalization.** FormalAlign [18] trains a model on both autoformalization and alignment scoring via a dual contrastive-generative loss, targeting Lean/Isabelle autoformalization. It is the closest published gold-free alignment scorer for formal languages. Our approach differs in that we use no learned alignment model: the consensus signal relies on z3 equivalence among independent translations, and the text-based signal uses deterministic checks and a prompted questionnaire. FormalAlign targets mathematical theorem proving, where the target language has a type checker; NL-FOL has no such verifier, making gold-free evaluation harder.

**Vacuity detection.** Kupferman and Vardi [16] formalise vacuity in temporal logic model checking. Our L1 lint layer includes a vacuity check (detecting formulas where a subformula can be replaced by its negation without changing the truth value), adapted from their framework.

**Cross-model translation confidence.** Bayless et al. [19] apply the same score form as c_score—the share of k independent LLM translations that entail a candidate—to NL-to-SMT translation, using a fixed schema and downstream QA accuracy as the label. It is the closest methodological precedent to our cross-family consensus metric, but operates on a fixed shared schema (removing the rename tradeoff) and evaluates against downstream task labels rather than z3-reference faithfulness labels. NoTB [20] uses four LLM families for requirements-to-temporal-logic translation and reports precision at coverage thresholds (63%-94.7% at ≥1-4 families), but does not compute AUROC or compare against judges.

**Trained verifiers for NL-FOL.** GenV [21] trains a single verifier for NL-to-FOL and achieves AUROC 0.961 on z3-reference labels, but only 0.679 under panel-intent labels (where the judge achieves 0.778). This label-target reversal illustrates that meta-evaluation results depend on whether labels measure solver equivalence or human intent. Our evaluation uses both: solver labels (R_AB) and panel-adjudicated labels (R_ADJ, dropped in iteration 2 for gate failure).

**Self-consistency for formal translation.** SCP-NL2TL [22] evaluates single-model self-consistency vs a judge vs back-translation for NL-to-temporal-logic translation, reporting that SC AUROC rises with difficulty tier. Our k-saturation finding (M4: k95 = 3) and the cross-family advantage (+0.140 over SC-5) extend this to cross-family consensus in the NL-FOL setting.

**Predicate alignment.** LogicLLaMA [23] uses a greedy binding search to maximise a logical-equivalence metric over predicate mappings. Vossel et al. [24] map predicates by normalised Levenshtein distance (threshold ≤ 0.6) before equivalence checking. Our aligner-based consensus (c_align) uses a similar principle but through z3 equivalence of aligned formulas. No prior work reports a rename false-alarm rate, which is our novel measurement (c_align 0.765, c_nf 0.132).

**N-version programming and correlated failure.** The consensus mechanism is an instance of N-version programming [25], where independent implementations vote on outputs. Chen and Avizienis [25] noted that "faulty but identical results (due to missing logic) may outvote correct results"—precisely the endorsement failure mode we measure (e = 0.124 on E, 0.459 under CSC). Eckhardt and Lee [26] predict that coincident failures rise with input difficulty; our M3 disconfirmation (the consensus advantage does not grow with complexity) is consistent with this prediction applying to both the metric and the judge.

<reviewer_feedback>
Feedback from the paper reviewer this iteration.

The previous review is BLOCKING: the paper must not ship as it stands. Every MUST-FIX item below is a requirement for this iteration, not a suggestion — an iteration that leaves one unaddressed does not publish.

- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) §5.6 says eval 4's corrections 'have been applied inline throughout'. Many of the record_final.md sections that eval 4 (art_TWLKblwXVifE) wrote for transcription were never carried into the report, and earlier text they correct is still there. Not applied: §12 (§4.6 rewrite). The report still says 'predicted d_floor (0.402) closely matches the observed END_MAJ d (0.415), indicating that the Part-1 model accounts for the observed disagreement' and 'R_exact AUROC (0.683) is the theoretical performance … on R_COMP'. §4.7 item 7 repeats 'closely matches', and the calibration failure is still blamed on non-transitivity. The 77%/61% wrong-peer decomposition, which record_final calls the main mechanism finding, is absent. §11 (§4.4/§4.5 caveats): §4.4 still says the drift gates 'all pass', with no stop-rule UNDECIDED and no 0.12-vs-0.84 track-H signal. §4.5 still says '70.7% contaminated' without 'upper bound'. §3.3 still gives FREE Δ +0.214 with no void marker. Also not transcribed: §6 (hypothesis verdicts), §7 (prior art, art_VIF75I5R6f0v), §13 (one cost table), §14 (spend table incl. $2.313 unaccounted), §15 (dead ends: the c_nf row still cites 'SWAP recall 0.512', and rename-selection, B1, FOL-Triage rewrite-FA, P2/P4, CSC variants and E2 EXC-core are missing), §16 (coverage against the request) and §17 ('What we have learned' replacement). §2.3 still says '588 items' (eval 1 common sets are regime-specific, e.g. R_SOLVER_CONS n = 373). eval 4's own reviewer_checklist.csv marks 9/11 items CLOSED because record_final.md contains them; the report does not. This is the third iteration in which a finished correction existed on disk and was not carried over.
  Action: Transcribe record_final.md §6, §7, §11, §12, §13, §14, §15, §16 and §17 into the report, each at its anchor, with its ~~original~~ [Correction …; source …] markers. Delete §5.6's 'applied inline throughout' and list which record_final sections were applied. Fix §2.3's '588' from eval 1 (common-set n per regime). This is transcription only.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) §5.2 (E2-A, art_ngTPhaVyXxhh) contradicts its artifact and leaves out every unfavourable cell. (a) 'The pre-registered flash-lite disguised bar has zero scored rows in R_AB'. I recomputed from per_item_E2A.jsonl: 1,427 rows have a flash-lite score, 71 of them in R_AB (63 DT, 8 long). tables.md DT cell: V0 − judge_cheap_disg = −0.083 [−0.266, 0.137] (n = 63), and ALL −0.082. Consensus sits below the pre-registered bar on the only cell where both exist. (b) Long pool (L25+EXC, 94 rows): V0 0.603 < local judge 0.695 < p_peer_text 0.704 ≈ l3_z3 0.706. V0 − local judge −0.091 [−0.219, 0.017]. Nested [S4_E2+V0] − S4_E2 = −0.064 [−0.134, −0.002]: adding consensus hurts. (c) ALL: [S4+V0]−S4 −0.009 [−0.034, 0.014]; c_score_align − S4 −0.040. On fresh data consensus adds nothing over the local stack. The artifact summary says this ('consensus ties a local 8B judge and adds nothing over it'); the report does not. (d) L25: c_score_align − p_peer_text −0.231 [−0.500, −0.064]. (e) H-MECH (iii) is printed as 'CONFIRMED … CI includes 0' ([−0.036, 0.855]), which contradicts itself. (f) Omitted: pilot metrics on E2 (joint-conflict 0.500, arity 0.507, dangling 0.413 inverted, rerun-Jaccard 0.713); R_A/R_VEX/nopilot cells; rename flips by stratum (NONCE L25 0.18, EXC 0.28, DT 0.93; SYN L25 0.0), so the rename weakness is concentrated in DT; drift gate PASS 0.955 on 269 items; deviations (17); cost ($0.000938/sentence FULL, 1.46 CPU-s marginal); spend $2.045, not 'included in dataset 4'. (g) E2-A is described as 'the untouched 110-sentence subset'. In fact all 550 sentences / 5,500 candidates were generated and scored; the 110 are the panel-labelled sha1 prefix.
  Action: Rewrite §5.2 from exp 11 tables.md: the T1 verdict block verbatim; R_AB LONG, L25, EXC, DT and ALL metric tables with paired-Δ rows (source results/auroc_cells.json); H-MECH with (iii) reworded as 'direction consistent, n.s.'; H-RENAME with FA / base FA / flip by stratum; the pilot-metric rows; cost and spend. Replace 'zero scored rows in R_AB' with the 71-row count and the DT/ALL V0 − flash-lite deltas. Add a one-line reading: on fresh data consensus ties the local judge on DT, is below it on the long pool, and adds nothing to the S4 stack.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) §5.4 (R_COMP FREE, art_5KczEbsFPx25) reports the favourable provisional delta and leaves out the tables that qualify it. (a) Aligner-free c_exact within-template AUROC is 0.606 (recomputed 0.6057). c_exact − judge_disg = +0.018 [−0.025, 0.059] n.s., and c_exact − judge_orig = −0.029 n.s. Without the name-similarity aligner, consensus does no better than the cheap judge in the in-scope free-vocabulary regime. The MAPPED label comes from a vocabulary-map search, so this is the shared-instrument concern again, and the report never states it. (b) The frontier judge (gemini-3.1-pro, 150 rows) reaches 0.852 vs c_align 0.801 (Δ −0.051 [−0.153, 0.044]), and [c+frontier]−[c] = +0.086 [0.003, 0.166]. (c) Complexity, which the user ranks first: in the original view the c_align − judge gap shrinks with length (W1 +0.285, W2 +0.164, W3 +0.084; Δ-of-Δ −0.201 [−0.307, −0.083]). c_align's own slope W3−W1 is −0.133 [−0.223, −0.035] in the disguised view. (d) The pre-registered placebo bar FAILED (17/20 shuffles cover 0, bar 18), and H-MECH (i) failed its bar (non-agreeing peers of MAPPED are 0.295/0.407 ERROR). (e) The majority-rule operating point flags 0.691 of MAPPED rows (recomputed 0.691). (f) The report presents 'noise-corrected c_align 0.973 vs judge 0.632' without saying that the artifact's differential check shows contamination is differential (audited-faithful ERROR_CERT rows score 0.74), which invalidates the correction. The orig-view Δ +0.171 and the audit-labelled view (c_align 0.899 vs judge_disg 0.522; vs judge_orig only +0.105 [0.011, 0.215]) are also omitted.
  Action: Add to §5.4, from results/tables.md with source lines: the full per-metric table including c_exact, g_align, g_nf and judge_local; the secondary deltas; the frontier block; the complexity table (both views); operating points; H-MECH (i)–(iv); placebos with FAIL stated; the audit-labelled view; the noise-correction table with its validity flags and the differential check. Add one sentence: 'the provisional advantage is carried by the aligner (c_exact ≈ judge), is beaten by the frontier judge, and shrinks with length in the original view'.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) §5.3 (E2-B, art_REMRsYjY1N4s) repeats the rename misreading that the previous review corrected for §4.3, and misstates spend and scope. (a) 'RENAME_NONCE FA 1.0; RENAME_SYN FA 0.968. The rename problem persists'. analysis_E2B.json::rename gives base FA on the CORRECT parents of 0.833/0.839 and paired flips of only 0.167/0.129. The any-label controls give flips 0.107/0.088 with reverse flips 0. I recomputed V0 FA on CORRECT rows at 0.833, and V0 flags 0.913 of all E2-B candidates. Most of the 'rename FA' is base FA; the finding is that V0 flags nearly everything on long sentences. (b) Spend is $0.830 (cost_ledger_master.jsonl), not $2.05. (c) 'unaudited MALLS gold, which iteration 3 showed is itself 42% wrong'. 42% is Brunello et al. [3]; the run's own figure is that E's panel rejected 82% of MALLS gold (dataset E card). (d) 'H_MECH(iii) REFUTED' is Δ −0.225 [−0.537, 0.113], CI covering 0. H-MECH (i)/(ii) are UNINFORMATIVE by construction (tautological under gold-equivalence labels); the report does not say so. (e) Omitted: the V0_decoupled − flash-lite lead +0.133 [−0.024, 0.314] (CI covers 0, so the exploratory advantage does not survive label decoupling); nested [S4+V0]−S4 +0.120; that S4_E2B dropped every local judge and round trip (no GPU), so S4 at 0.498 is not the stack used elsewhere; system τ V0 0.467 vs flash-lite −0.315; the V1–V5 rows; the frontier run (10 rows only).
  Action: Rewrite §5.3 from analysis/tables.md §0–§6: the full exploratory table with tie rates, the delta table, the label-coupling line with its CI, H-MECH with the UNINFORMATIVE labels, the rename block with base FA and paired flips, the S4 feature substitutions, system τ, and the correct spend. Replace 'rename problem persists' with 'V0 flags 83% of CORRECT parents; renaming adds 13–17% flips'.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) §5.5 (exp 14, art_EU1yuNrRl4od) and 'What we have learned' omit the development-data facts that bear most directly on long sentences. (a) T5: V0 at c > 0.5 has d = 0.811 on L25 and 0.913 in word tercile T3. It flags 81–91% of CORRECT long translations, with an overall flag rate of 0.740. (b) T8: V0 − judge_cheap_disg on L25 is +0.072 [−0.015, 0.153], n.s. The 'beats the best cheap judge by +0.101' headline is ALL-strat. On the stratum the user cares about most, the development advantage is not significant; record_final §16 already gives L25 Δ +0.069 [−0.020, 0.148]. (c) c_exact beats V0 on CTRL (+0.119 [0.028, 0.208]). (d) The V1/V3/V5 mechanism, where plurality normalisation trades d for e (ALL d 0.490 → 0.174, e 0.140 → 0.343; MEANING_RENAME-type e 0.502 → 0.872), is the iteration's answer to the 'wrong-peer cause' the hypothesis set out to attack, and it is not in the report. T5b shows no variant lowers d without raising e. (e) GG gates g1 and g2 'pass' only because base FA is 0.83 (T10); this is not stated. GG_B is called 'UNTESTED' although its all-accepted bracket was computed (ALL-strat 0.653, e 0.334, Δ vs V0 −0.090). G-B is NOT_TESTABLE (53 YES pairs). (f) Spend is $0.219 (cost_ledger.jsonl), not '$0.00 (CPU-only)'. (g) The 'NET +0.401' in 'What we have learned' is exp 14 T5c's V0 row but carries no source; §3.5 gives NET +0.356 (END_MAJ), and the two are not reconciled.
  Action: Add exp 14 T5, T5b, T5c, T8 (with the L25 column), T10 with its base-FA caveat, T11 and T13 to §5.5 with source lines. State in 'What we have learned' that the development advantage on L25 is +0.072 [−0.015, 0.153] n.s. and that V0 flags 81% of correct L25 translations. Name the NET definition next to each NET value.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (scope) Coverage against the original request is partial, and the report still has no table saying so. It was a MUST-FIX last round, and record_final §16 has one ready. On the user's top priority, long heavily conditioned sentences with no controlled vocabulary, the evidence now is as follows. Development E L25: n.s. vs judge. E2-A long pool: V0 below the local judge and hurting the S4 stack. E2-A L25: 0.443 on 7 CORRECT rows. E2-B: untestable, unaudited gold, lead not surviving decoupling. R_COMP FREE: provisional only, aligner-carried, advantage shrinking with length in the orig view. Error-type identification is negative outside a shared vocabulary. Invariance: V0 fails rename controls. The deliverable functions exist (exp 11 lib/nl2fol_metrics.py with 'measures / does not measure' docstrings; exp 14 lib/api.py; freelab, consensus_lib) but no section lists them. 'What we have learned' still opens with 'the strongest gold-free faithfulness signal found' and with SIG 0.954, and it never states that no long-sentence cell on fresh data favours consensus.
  Action: Transcribe record_final §16 as 'Coverage against the request' and fill its 'pending in iteration 5' column from confirm_verdict_E2A.json, analysis_E2B.json, confirm_verdict_rcomp.json and exp 14 selection.json, with one-line answers per requirement. Add a function-inventory table (function, file, input signature, what it measures / does not measure, gold-free or gold-using) from exp 11 lib/nl2fol_metrics.py, exp 14 lib/api.py and lib/PROVENANCE.json. Rewrite the first paragraph of 'What we have learned' so the long-sentence verdict is stated first.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) Internal contradictions left from earlier iterations. (a) M3 is 'DISCONFIRMED' in the §3.2 verdict table, in the §3.2 heading 'M3: complexity slope (DISCONFIRMED)', in §3.6 item 9 ('M3 disconfirmation is informative … cannot be relied upon') and in Related Work ('our M3 disconfirmation'). It is 'INCONCLUSIVE (two specifications conflict)' in §3.5, §3.6 item 6, §5.6 and the limitations. (b) §3.4 says 'c_align … most sensitive to SWAP (0.882) and NEG (0.869), least sensitive to DROP' and then, in the same paragraph, that the per-operator consensus column is a base-endorsement artefact from which no ranking can be read. (c) §3.3 still shows the SIG row as 'PASS True' and 'the largest effect observed in any test', with no marker that SIG is out of scope; §3.6 item 3 says NOT CONFIRMED. (d) The §3.3 cost line gives the frontier judge as '$0.00605 per call (30.2× …)', but 30.2× is $0.00365/item ÷ $0.000121, and exp 13 now gives $0.00477/call. (e) The CSC summary still says 'below … the flash-lite judge (0.664)'. The paired Δ is −0.050 [−0.212, +0.107], n.s. (exp 9 T5), and this is not stated.
  Action: Put [Correction] markers on each of (a)–(e): M3 → INCONCLUSIVE in all four places; strike the §3.4 operator ranking sentence; strike 'PASS True' / 'largest effect' in §3.3 or annotate 'out-of-scope SIG'; use the record_final §13 cost table; add 'n.s.' to the CSC-vs-flash-lite sentences in §4.2 and §4.7.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (novelty) The run's positive claims still have no nearest-neighbour check in the record, and the research artifact art_VIF75I5R6f0v still has no [ARTIFACT] marker, no scoop-rule statement and no C1–C5 verdict table. This was MUST-FIX last round, and record_final §7 contains the section ready to paste. The references [19]–[22] appear only in Related Work prose. The iteration-5 positive claims are the R_COMP FREE provisional c_align > judge, the DT 0.916 cell and 'V0 stands'. Their nearest neighbours: ARc/Bayless et al. 2025 (arXiv 2511.09008) uses the same score form (share of k translations entailing the candidate) over a fixed shared schema. GenV (arXiv 2609.11085) reports single-verifier AUROC 0.961 on z3-reference labels. In the run's own R_COMP FREE data the frontier judge beats c_align. What this run adds beyond ARc is a per-candidate meta-evaluation against judges on NL→FOL with free vocabulary, and the fresh-data version of that is untestable or negative. The report should say that.
  Action: Paste record_final §7 as '3.7 Prior-art positioning [ARTIFACT:art_VIF75I5R6f0v]' (scoop rule, closest-neighbour table, C1–C5 verdicts with qualifiers). Under §5.4 and in 'What we have learned', add one sentence each naming ARc and GenV and stating what the provisional FREE result adds (and that the frontier judge exceeds it there).
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (clarity) §5.1 records what iteration 5 attempted but not why. It omits the previous review (score 3, blocking, 11 critiques) and which critiques eval 4 was built to close. It omits the iter-4 hypothesis update: move 'deepen', title 'Cross-model agreement, tested on fresh data', relation 'evolution', confidence 'decreased', and the move_rationale 'confirm frozen consensus on untouched E2/R_COMP FREE (fix each once), attack wrong-peer cause at $0; CSC closed'. It omits why V1–V5 were the chosen attack on the wrong-peer cause, and the pre-registered stopping rules. The budget story is also inconsistent. §5.7 says 'the run-wide budget ($7.00)'. The iteration-5 artifacts all state a $12 run-level budget exhausted at about 11:39–11:40 UTC. The listed spend is wrong for three of five artifacts (exp 11 $2.045, exp 12 $0.830, exp 14 $0.219; actual iteration total about $5.06). The $2.313 unaccounted from iteration 4 (record_final §14) is not mentioned.
  Action: Open §5 with an 8–10 line reasoning block drawn from iter_4/upd_hypo (.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json: title, move, move_rationale, coverage_statement) and iter_5/gen_strat/gen_strat_1/README.md. Replace the spend line with a ledger-sourced table (per artifact; budget $12; stop time). Carry record_final §14's unaccounted $2.313 into §4.
- [MINOR] (evidence) The dead-ends table in §5.7 adds GG but is otherwise unchanged. The c_nf reason is still 'SWAP recall 0.512', while §3.4 now says the name-free line ended through MEANING_RENAME blindness plus the failed pre-registered selection, with a 'see below' that points to nothing. Missing rows are listed in record_final §15. Iteration 5 adds candidates too: V1/V3/V5 plurality normalisation (trades d for e; selection NONE), GG_B (bridges absorb ADD/DROP errors, bracket 0.653), the gloss-gated R_COMP FREE labelling route (gate failed twice: haiku 0.776/0.561, qwen 0.855/0.883), and the E2/E2-B panel route (budget-stopped, 0 completed E2-B batches).
  Action: Replace the table with record_final §15 plus these iteration-5 rows, each with a source file (exp 14 selection_E.json / ggb_dev.json; exp 13 gate_diagnostics.json; exp 12 e2b/progress.jsonl).
- [MINOR] (methodology) The iteration-5 summary headlines cells too thin to support what is said about them. 'L25 on E2 is near chance … the consensus metric collapses on the long-sentence confirmation stratum that matters most' rests on 42 rows, 7 CORRECT and 6 sentences, with CI [0.375, 0.500] and testable = False. The artifact's own note is that such cells cannot be read. 'DT stratum is a bright spot' omits that consensus ties the local 8B judge there, is below flash-lite on the 63 rows where flash-lite exists, and adds nothing over S4. Symmetrically, the exploratory E2-B '+0.208' is repeated in 'What we have learned' without its decoupled lead [−0.024, 0.314].
  Action: Tag each iteration-5 cell in the summary with n (ERR/COR/sentences) and testable flag, and give the paired comparisons the artifacts computed next to each AUROC. Drop 'collapses' and 'bright spot' in favour of the numbers.

<ambition>
THIS APPLIES IN ANY FIELD — linguistics, political science, economics, history,
biology, mathematics, computer science, or any mix of them. Where an example
below names a unit of study, read it as whatever your field's equivalent is:
languages, elections, markets, periods, corpora, species, model families, proof
techniques.

THE DEFAULT DELIVERABLE IS A NOVEL CONTRIBUTION. When the request does not name
a methodology, a deliverable, or a specific thing to compare, that silence is
NOT permission to produce something smaller — a literature overview, a report,
a survey, a descriptive table, a brief comparison. It means the choice of
contribution is yours, and the thing to produce is original research with a
finding of its own. Only an explicit request for a review or a replication
changes that.

CALIBRATE AMBITION TO WHAT THE REQUEST LEAVES OPEN. Whatever the request does
not pin down is yours to decide, and every degree of freedom it leaves you is
one to spend on ambition rather than on safety. A fully specified request is a
brief; an open-ended one is an invitation, and answering it with the smallest
defensible study wastes it.

THE TARGET is the most ambitious claim you can still expect to LAND — to finish
within the available resources with a non-trivial, genuinely insightful,
POSITIVE result. Both halves bind. Ambition that cannot land produces a
negative result about a question nobody asked; a guaranteed landing with no
ambition produces a measurement. Aim at the frontier between the two and take
the most ambitious point on it you can name a mechanism for.

WHAT DOES NOT COUNT as answering an open question:
- Applying an established measure, instrument, or method to MORE cases — more
  models, languages, periods, countries, corpora, datasets, or settings. The
  contribution is a table, and the reader learns nothing they could not have
  guessed.
- Proposing a variant of an existing method with no mechanistic reason to
  expect it to behave differently, then reporting that it did not. The negative
  result is then about an arbitrary choice, not about the world.
- Re-describing a known effect in new vocabulary, or naming it.
- A survey, a ranking, or a replication — unless that is what was asked for.

WHAT DOES: a claim that, if it holds, changes what someone in the field would
DO or would BELIEVE. Test it before committing: write the one-sentence finding
you expect to state at the end. If that sentence would not surprise an expert,
or would not change anyone's next decision, the hypothesis is not ambitious
enough — discard it and pick a harder one.

POSITIVE BY DESIGN, NOT BY LUCK. Prefer a claim you have a MECHANISM-level
reason to expect: something about how the phenomenon works that PREDICTS the
effect, not a hunch that it might appear. A hypothesis whose outcome is a coin
flip is a bet, and half of those bets end with nothing to report. Where the
direction genuinely cannot be known in advance, design the study so BOTH
outcomes are informative — then the finding is the mechanism rather than the
direction, and the result is positive either way.

SCALE THE CLAIM, NOT THE AMBITION, when resources bind. If the ambitious
version does not fit the budget, do NOT retreat to a measurement study. Narrow
what the claim COVERS — one language instead of twenty, one period, one
population, one model family — while keeping the mechanism it is about intact.
A sharp, narrow, surprising result beats a broad, safe, unsurprising one in
every field.
</ambition>

<evidence_state_and_move>
This is iteration 5 of 5. This is the FINAL iteration — no iteration follows this one.
Your revision is the ONLY thing that decides where the next iteration points,
so work the three steps below in order and do not skip to a conclusion.

The run is looking for a POSITIVE, NON-OBVIOUS result. A null is a last
resort, never a destination.

STEP 1 — CLASSIFY EVERY STRAND, SEPARATELY.

A STRAND is ONE artifact of this round: one bet, one test, one attempted
answer. Put EVERY artifact this round produced into `strands` — one entry
each, no merging, no omissions — with `artifact` (its name or id exactly as
listed above), `state`, and `why` (≤200 chars: the number, or the defect).
Rounds are MIXED. Judging a round as a whole is how one real positive gets
thrown away with the nulls around it.

- "genuine_positive" — ALL FOUR must hold:
  (a) the number was EXECUTED, not projected, assumed or placeholder;
  (b) it is at a size the ORIGINAL ask would care about — not the smallest
      size that clears a significance threshold;
  (c) it survived the obvious alternative explanation — the baseline, the
      confound, the simpler account that would produce the same number;
  (d) a reader in the field could NOT have predicted it before you ran it,
      and it is not already published.
- "lead" — real, but not yet genuine. A small effect in the right direction;
  a positive that lost to a baseline or missed a pre-registered bar by a
  margin; a signal seen on ONE body of evidence only. A lead is something to
  CHASE, not something to report.
- "null" — it ran and left nothing to build on: no effect, or one you cannot
  separate from the baseline or from noise.
- "broken" — it never tested the claim. A defect in the code, the data, the
  measure, the sample or the setup, a run that did not finish, or numbers
  that were never executed. The claim is UNTESTED here, not refuted.

STEP 2 — READ THE ROUND SUMMARY OFF THE BEST STRAND.

`evidence_state` is NOT a separate judgement. It is whichever of these fires
first:

- any strand "genuine_positive"  ->  "strong_survivor"
- else any strand "lead"         ->  "lead"
- else any strand "null"         ->  "weak_or_null"
- else (every strand "broken")   ->  "experiment_broken"

STEP 3 — READ THE MOVE OFF THE SUMMARY. A lookup, not a judgement — the
judgement was STEP 1:

- "strong_survivor" -> LATCH ON. `deepen` (why does it hold — the mechanism,
  the boundary where it stops, the confound that would explain it away) or
  `extend` (replication in a SECOND family, population, period, corpus or
  case set). HOLD the title and the object of the positive strand: do not
  rewrite the run around a different question while a real result is alive.
  Null strands of this round are CLOSED — one sentence in the paper, no
  further budget.
- "lead" -> `deepen` ON THAT LEAD. WEAK IS NOT NULL. Make it BIGGER and
  CLEANER before abandoning it: more power, a cleaner measure, the baseline
  it lost to attacked head-on, the second body of evidence it has not been
  seen on. `widen` here ONLY if this same lead was ALREADY deepened last
  round and came back null.
- "weak_or_null" AND at least one iteration remains -> `widen`. MANDATORY.
  Not "consider widening". Every artifact next round is a DIFFERENT bet on
  the ORIGINAL ask; none of them refines the idea that just failed.
- "experiment_broken" -> `fix`, ONCE. Keep the claim EXACTLY as it is, name
  the defect precisely in `move_rationale`, and say what a correct test looks
  like. Do not reframe, soften or re-scope a claim that was never tested.
  BROKEN IS FIXED ONCE: if the SAME bet already came back "broken" in the
  previous round's strands, it is not a defect any more — drop that bet and
  give its slot to a new candidate.
- `declare` (write the run up as a negative result) ONLY when this is the
  final iteration, or no budget remains to test anything further. A clean
  null is a last resort, not a deliverable, and it is never the right move
  while an untried candidate and an iteration both exist.

HOW TO WIDEN, when the rule says widen:

1. Go back to the USER'S ORIGINAL ASK — not to the hypothesis you just
   refuted. The refuted hypothesis was one answer to that ask; the ask is
   still open.
2. Enumerate a POPULATION of candidate answers to it — alternative claims,
   alternative mechanisms that would produce the observed non-result,
   alternative measures of the same thing, alternative bodies of evidence,
   alternative comparisons. Aim for many and cheap, not one and careful.
   Write down how many you weighed.
3. Propose a CHEAP SCREEN that tests all of them at once, coarsely, at a cost
   comparable to one deep test — and a HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION that the screen
   never saw, for whichever candidate survives it.
4. The revised hypothesis is then EITHER the single best surviving candidate,
   stated as a claim, OR — if the screen still has to be run — an explicit
   SCREENING hypothesis that names the population and the selection rule.
   Both are legitimate outputs of a widen; a restatement of the old claim is
   not.

<narrow_salvage_ban>
The failure this procedure exists to stop: a null result, and the revision
quietly shrinks the claim until whatever the data did show becomes the claim
— a smaller population, a milder verb, a subgroup, a weaker measure, an
effect in the direction everyone already expected. Each step is defensible.
The run ends with a finding nobody needed.

What is banned is SHRINKING THE CLAIM TO FIT A NULL. It is NOT a ban on
pursuing a small real effect: keeping a "lead" strand alive and going after
it harder next round is the opposite move, and it is required rather than
forbidden — the claim stays the size it was and the TEST gets stronger.

So: you may not REWRITE the claim down to the size of the effect you happened
to observe, UNLESS the paper can state why that smaller effect is ITSELF the
answer to the ask — a bound someone needed, a mechanism that only shows up at
that size, a belief it overturns. If you cannot write that sentence, the move
is `deepen` on the lead or `widen`, never a smaller claim.
</narrow_salvage_ban>

<screening_discipline>
Widening multiplies the number of claims in play, and a population of
candidates screened on one body of evidence will always contain one that
looks good by chance. So a widen is only honest with the discipline attached:

- Report `candidates_considered` — how many alternative claims you actually
  weighed this revision, not how many you could imagine. 1 means you weighed
  none, and after a weak or null result with budget left, 1 is a failure to
  do the move.
- A candidate is SCREENED on one body of evidence and CONFIRMED on another
  that the screen never touched — a held-out split, a later period, a
  different population, corpus, site, cohort or case set. Say in the revised
  hypothesis which evidence is which.
- The winner of a screen is a CANDIDATE, never yet a finding. Do not write a
  screening result as the answer, and do not report the best of several
  screened effects as though it had been the only one tested.
- Never re-screen on the confirmation evidence after seeing it. If the
  confirmation fails, that candidate is dead; go back to the population, do
  not go hunting for a subgroup where it survives.
</screening_discipline>

COVERAGE. Independently of the move, answer: does the hypothesis you are
about to write still answer the USER'S ORIGINAL ASK? Set `coverage` to
"full" (it answers the ask), "partial" (it answers a recognisable piece of
it) or "lost" (the run has drifted onto a different question), and write one
sentence in `coverage_statement` saying which part of the ask the next
iteration will answer. "lost" is not a failure to hide — it is the signal
that the next iteration must go back to the ask.
</evidence_state_and_move>

<task>
IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Work the procedure above in order, then write the revision:

1. Classify EVERY artifact of this round separately into `strands` — one entry per artifact,
   no merging, no omissions — judging from what it ACTUALLY produced: an executed number, not
   a projected, assumed or placeholder one. States: `genuine_positive`, `lead`, `null`,
   `broken`.
2. Read the round summary off the BEST strand and set `evidence_state`. It is derived, not
   judged: genuine_positive -> "strong_survivor", else lead -> "lead", else null ->
   "weak_or_null", else "experiment_broken". A summary that disagrees with your own strands
   is rejected.
3. Read the move off the summary. Set `move` and `move_rationale` (≤200 chars). The rule is
   not advisory:
   - "strong_survivor" -> LATCH: `deepen` or `extend` on THAT strand's object, title held.
     The null strands of this round are closed — one sentence in the paper, no more budget.
   - "lead" -> `deepen` on the lead. WEAK IS NOT NULL: make it bigger and cleaner (more
     power, a cleaner measure, the baseline it lost to attacked head-on) before abandoning
     it. Widen off a lead only if it was already deepened last round and came back null.
   - "weak_or_null" with an iteration remaining -> `widen`.
   - "experiment_broken" -> `fix`, once; a bet broken twice is dropped, not fixed again.
   - "declare" only on the final iteration or with no budget left.
4. If the move is `widen`, do the widen properly — go back to the user's ORIGINAL ask,
   enumerate a population of candidate answers, propose a cheap screen over all of them and a
   held-out confirmation for the survivor, and set `candidates_considered` to how many you
   actually weighed. The revised hypothesis is the best surviving candidate, or an explicit
   screening hypothesis naming the population and the selection rule. Every bet the next
   round makes must be a DIFFERENT answer to the ask — none of them refines the failed idea.
5. If the move is `fix`, keep the claim word-for-word and name the defect in `move_rationale`.
6. Set `coverage` and `coverage_statement` against the user's ORIGINAL ask, not against the
   hypothesis you are revising.
7. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly. A reviewer asking you to
   shrink a claim is LEGITIMATE when your own strand classification agrees — the effect is a
   `lead` or a `null` — and is to be refused when a `genuine_positive` strand exists: you do
   not shrink a claim the evidence actually supports.

Write the revision as a hypothesis the next iteration can act on: `title`, `hypothesis`,
`key_changes`, and `confidence_delta` ("increased", "decreased" or "unchanged").

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — bookkeeping only, and NOT the steering decision (`move` is).
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the steering fields and the H↔H relation
fields) AND the full list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.

I work on converting natural-language text into first-order logic (NL→FOL, autoformalization) with
LLM pipelines. Evaluation is the bottleneck. Correct FOL for a sentence is not unique — different
predicate names, different decompositions of the same concept, and logically equivalent rewrites can
all be correct. Gold FOL annotations are rare and expensive. The metrics in use either need a gold
formula (exact match, BLEU, prover-checked equivalence to the gold) or only check that the output
parses. In my own pilot I used cheap structural metrics: whether a set of generated formulas loads
together without conflicts, whether predicate arities stay consistent, how many predicates are used
but never defined, and how similar the predicate sets are across reruns. Those measure stability and
composability, not whether a formula says what the sentence says.

Find new metrics for NL→FOL output quality. Operating situation: you are given a natural-language
sentence (or short passage) and a candidate FOL formalization produced by any system. There is no gold
formula, no ontology or controlled vocabulary, and no domain knowledge. The metric returns a score
that predicts whether the formalization is faithful to the text, and ideally which kind of error it
contains (quantifier or scope error, dropped or added condition, negation/polarity error, swapped
arguments, conflated or wrongly split concepts). Metrics may score a single formula or a set (several
samples for one sentence, or the formalizations of all sentences in one document). They must be
task-agnostic — usable for any NL→FOL setting, not tied to a domain, dataset or pipeline — and cheap
enough to run on every output (solver calls and small models are fine; a large-LLM judge per formula
only if shown to earn its cost).

Requirements:
- Keep the target fixed: the metric must predict faithfulness to the text. Detecting synthetic
  perturbations, parse validity, or run-to-run stability are not substitutes for that target.
- Validate against ground truth, never against the metric itself. Use public datasets with gold
  sentence-level FOL (e.g. FOLIO, MALLS, or others you find) to build a meta-evaluation set: real
  candidate formalizations from several different systems, plus controlled perturbations of gold
  formulas with known error types, labelled via prover-checked equivalence to gold. Handle two known
  problems: some gold annotations are wrong, and a candidate can be correct without being equivalent
  to the gold (different vocabulary or granularity). Estimate how often each happens and how it
  biases the labels. These datasets are public, so check whether LLM-based metrics benefit from having
  seen the gold.
- For each metric report: correlation with correctness at item and system level; sensitivity per error
  type; invariance under meaning-preserving rewrites (variable/predicate renaming, reordering,
  equivalent restatements); coverage — unparseable outputs are counted and reported, never silently
  dropped; and cost.
- Compare against baselines: parse/compile rate, round-trip (FOL→NL→compare) similarity,
  LLM-as-judge, sampling self-consistency, and the structural consistency metrics described above. A
  new metric matters only if it adds signal those don't.
- Report how each metric's reliability changes with sentence complexity (length, number of quantifiers,
  nesting depth, number of conditions and exceptions). Long, heavily conditioned sentences matter most
  to me.
- Negative results are welcome: if a family of metrics does not track correctness, show that clearly.

Out of scope: comparing grounded vs ungrounded generation (ontology vocabulary injected into prompts),
anything that depends on a particular ontology, and building a better NL→FOL translator. The
contribution is the measurement, not the translator.

Deliverables: reusable Python functions taking (text, fol) — or a set of such pairs — each with a
precise statement of what it measures; the meta-evaluation dataset with its labels; and the results.

I appended a pilot study of this problem with some metrics I already used but haven't verified. Just for reference.
