<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A research paper writer (Step 3.4: GEN_REPORT_TEXT in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, all artifacts, the previous paper draft (if any), and reviewer feedback.
Write a complete paper draft with figure placeholders.

Publication-quality paper → strong contribution. Weak paper → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher keeping a lab notebook, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points and not
an author selling a paper. The publishable paper is written later, by a different step, out of
what you record here; anything you leave out is lost to it.

- Chronological, one section per iteration, in the order they ran. The shape of the document is the shape of the run.
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions, and reproduce the table they came from.
- Completeness beats selection: every experiment and every table, including the ones that went nowhere. Selection is the paper step's job and it cannot select what you did not write down.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. A dead end is recorded as a dead end, with the evidence that killed it — never spun as "future work".
- No headline, no contribution claim, no abstract framing. Say what happened.
</research_methodology>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_report_text/gen_report_text`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Write the workspace path of each kept artifact into your results and your
`README.md`, so the paper can cite it by path rather than by a link that
was never pushed.

If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends.

<report_rules>
This document is the run's INTERNAL RESEARCH REPORT. It is not the paper. A separate step writes
the publishable paper at the end of the run, out of this report, and it can only publish what it
can read here.

- CHRONOLOGICAL. One section per iteration, in order, under a heading that names the iteration.
  Earlier sections are not rewritten; they are the record of what was believed at the time.
- COMPLETE. EVERY experiment and EVERY table, in full. A result that exists in an artifact
  workspace and not here is a defect: open the output files and copy the numbers out of them.
  Never summarise a table away, never write "results were promising" in place of the table.
- REASONED. At every step, in the run's own words: why this strategy, why these artifacts, what
  the reviewer objected to and why, what the hypothesis update concluded and why it moved.
- DEAD ENDS KEPT, and labelled as dead ends, with the evidence that killed them. A direction that
  was abandoned is a finding; deleting it makes the run look luckier than it was.
- BOOKKEEPING WELCOME. Numbers, file hashes, run ids, timestamps, per-iteration spend and review
  scores belong here. (They are the one thing the paper may NOT carry, so this is their only home.)
- NO SELLING. No abstract framing, no contribution claims, no reaching for significance. A lab
  notebook written up: what was done, what came out, what it means, what is still open.
- NO SEEKING A POSITIVE RESULT. The report does not lead with the best number, and it does not
  arrange the evidence to flatter the run. A null result, a failed attempt and a confirmed effect
  are written up the same way and given the same room; the reader is a researcher who has to see
  what was thought, when, and on what basis, not a finding sold to them.
- EVERY NUMBER RECOMPUTED FROM THE ROWS. Any figure you state — in a table, in the text, in the
  closing section — is read out of the artifact's own output files, never copied from an earlier
  iteration's summary line. That line is what the run believed then; the files are what it has.
- READABLE AS A SEQUENCE. Tables and figures where they make the thinking easy to follow, each
  one placed in the iteration that produced it and captioned with what it was meant to settle.
- WRITTEN FOR A READER WHO WAS NOT THERE. Complete is not the same as raw. The prose is prose: a
  researcher who never saw the run reads it start to finish and follows what happened and why.
  The digits live in the tables and the captions; a sentence carries the COMPARISON, not the
  decimals ("the reranker halved tail latency, at a quarter of the throughput" — the table next
  to it has 4.6 s, 2.0 s, 118 qps, 31 qps). The aii-paper-writing skill's style rules are the
  house style here too: they are about how sentences work, not about selling a result, and a
  report written to them is still the complete, chronological, unsold record.
</report_rules>
<writing_register>
Write in the register of the field's best papers (the passages you save to `./style_exemplars.md`), not in the register of a language
model. Four things are measured on the finished draft, and a draft outside them is sent back with
the numbers:
- Never use: delve, underscore, showcase, intricate, pivotal, realm, commendable, meticulous, tapestry, garner, multifaceted, it is worth noting, plays a crucial role, not only ... but also. These are 10 to 30 times more frequent in machine-written abstracts than in
  human ones, and reviewers read them as such.
- Em dashes: at most 3 per 1,000 words. Use a comma, a colon or a full stop.
- Sentence rhythm: mix short and long sentences. An interquartile range of sentence length under
  8 words reads as machine-written.
- Hedging: at most 15 hedges (may, likely, suggests, appears) per 1,000
  words. State what the evidence supports plainly; hedge where it is thin, not everywhere.
Style never changes substance: numbers, claims, citations and figure markers stay exactly as the
evidence gives them. The user's original request (delivered as a separate message) overrides all
of this wherever the two conflict.
THIS REPORT TAKES THE EXEMPLARS' REGISTER AND NOTHING ELSE OF THEIRS.
The STYLE EXEMPLARS todo saves `./style_exemplars.md` before you write; read its
passages and write the sentences of your section the way those papers write theirs: the same sentence length and rhythm,
the same use of "we", numbers stated as plainly as they state them, citations as dense. That is
sentence-level only. Their selling stays with them: no contribution framing, no leading with the
best number. So does their structure: the section outlines in that file are for the publishable
paper, and this report keeps the chronological shape <report_rules> gives it. Every rule in
<report_rules> outranks the exemplars; a report that reads like the field's papers but drops a
table or a dead end has failed.
</writing_register>
<domain_vocabulary>
How this document names things. Four rules, and the draft is checked against them:

- Name each concept, metric and condition the way the field names it. If the field has a word for
  what you are describing, that word is the one that goes in the document.
- Never invent a private label for something the field already names. A reader searching for the
  standard term has to be able to find this work.
- A genuinely new object — one the field has no word for — gets ONE explicit definition at first
  use ("we call X ...", "we define X as ...") and exactly the same words everywhere after it.
- Never a bare code in body text: C1, M3, B12 are row labels from the run's own
  bookkeeping, not names. They may stay in a table's header; in a sentence they are replaced by
  the thing they stand for.

No list has been compiled yet: you compile it yourself in the STYLE
EXEMPLARS todo and write it to `./domain_terms.json`. The four rules above bind the section
you write today all the same, checked against that file as you build it.

# Gold-Free Faithfulness Metrics for NL-to-FOL Translation

## Framing

Translating natural language into first-order logic (NL-FOL) is a prerequisite for neurosymbolic reasoning pipelines [10], yet evaluating whether a candidate formula faithfully captures a sentence's meaning remains an open problem. Gold FOL annotations are expensive, non-unique, and unreliable: Brunello et al. [3] found that approximately 42% of entries in both FOLIO [1] and MALLS [2] contain incorrect formalisations. Existing metrics either require a gold formula (exact match, prover-checked equivalence) or only verify that the output parses [5, 6]. The user's own pilot study used structural consistency checks (arity agreement, predicate-set overlap across reruns, joint satisfiability) that measure stability but not whether a formula says what its sentence says.

This run investigates gold-free metrics that predict faithfulness to the text given only a sentence and a candidate formula, with no reference formula, no ontology, and no domain knowledge. The evaluation is a meta-evaluation: we build a labelled set of (sentence, formula) pairs from public benchmarks whose gold has been audited, and measure each metric's ability to discriminate correct translations from errors.

## Iteration 1

### 1.1 Strategy

The iteration screens four candidate metric families head-to-head on a frozen evaluation set, with a disguised cheap LLM judge as the bar to beat.

**Candidates.** (A) FOL-Triage, a three-layer cascade: L1 (formula lint: deterministic formula smells), L2 (text accounting: bag-of-words and role-aware coverage), and L3 (role questionnaire: a small LLM reads the text and z3 reads the formula; their structured answers are compared). (B) Round-trip verification: verbalise the formula back to natural language and compare to the original via NLI or embedding similarity [7]. (C) Cross-system consensus: collect translations of the same sentence from multiple independent systems, measure z3-equivalence between the candidate and the peer pool, and score disagreement [8]. (D) Disguised cheap judge and baselines: an LLM judge, structural pilot metrics, and round-trip features evaluated on nonce-disguised sentences to control for memorisation.

**Evaluation set.** The frozen screen uses Logic-LM [10] released outputs on FOLIO validation: three LLM systems (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, text-davinci-003) producing 796 items. Track L contains LLM outputs labelled by z3 equivalence to corrected gold [4]; track H contains the 294 original human gold formulas, of which 57 are errors according to the corrected labels. The parallel run (run_qY2a2IS-WLIs) measured 43.9% of solver-non-equivalent candidates as faithful by a three-family panel; iteration 2 will re-score with those adjudicated labels.

**Decision rule.** A candidate must achieve AUROC ≥ 0.65 on track L (ERROR vs CORRECT), with coverage ≥ 90%, rewrite false-alarm rate ≤ 10% per rewrite family, and cost ≤ $0.002 per item. It advances only if its AUROC exceeds the disguised cheap judge's, with a paired bootstrap CI excluding zero.

**Held-out dataset (Artifact E).** A separate 700-sentence, 8,507-row held-out set was constructed from FOLIO training premises, MALLS training long/conditional/exception strata, and FOLIO curated conclusions, each translated by 9 LLM families plus ccg2lambda plus GPT-4 gold. Labels were assigned by z3 equivalence to audited gold, with contested cases adjudicated by a three-member panel (Claude Haiku-4.5, GLM-4.6, Kimi-K2). This set is reserved for iteration 2 confirmation. [ARTIFACT:art_U4Hsqt4Ay9Tg]

The dataset contains 1,750 CORRECT, 5,005 ERROR, 1,086 UNPARSEABLE, 276 UNRESOLVED, and 390 CONTESTED items. The panel calibration subset (173 items) shows that the panel agrees with expert-corrected labels on both faithful and unfaithful items. A screen audit of 1,173 items from the Logic-LM screen confirms the label assignment. The dataset cost $9.83 in API calls.

### 1.2 Experiment A: FOL-Triage

[ARTIFACT:art_d0njuqy2Csj-]

FOL-Triage was evaluated on the frozen screen with Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite as the primary LLM for L3. Total API spend was $0.29.

#### Headline AUROCs (track L, ERROR vs CORRECT, n = 477, 199 errors)

| Metric | AUROC | 95% CI | AUPRC |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 (any smell) | 0.508 | [0.499, 0.519] | 0.425 |
| L2 bag-of-words | 0.737 | [0.677, 0.801] | 0.690 |
| L2 role-aware | 0.557 | [0.527, 0.594] | 0.476 |
| L3 score | 0.756 | [0.701, 0.809] | 0.657 |
| Fused (fitted on H, no leak) | 0.759 | [0.695, 0.825] | 0.740 |
| Fused (all H) | 0.827 | [0.778, 0.874] | 0.771 |
| Fused (cross-fit L) | 0.864 | [0.824, 0.902] | 0.789 |
| Decomposed judge (LLM reads formula) | 0.716 | [0.645, 0.789] | 0.717 |
| L3 with local Qwen2.5-1.5B | 0.708 | [0.637, 0.774] | 0.603 |

The primary no-leak fused score is 0.759. The fused-all-H and cross-fit-L numbers (0.827, 0.864) are shown for completeness but are not valid held-out estimates: the former uses the full track H for fitting, and the latter is a within-L cross-fit that overstates generalisation.

**Track H (human gold errors, n = 258, 57 errors).** Fused out-of-fold AUROC is 0.777 [0.698, 0.847]. L1 alone reaches 0.655, compared to 0.508 on track L. The lint rules fire on human annotation errors but not on LLM outputs, because the two populations produce different formula smells.

#### L1 lint: a negative result on LLM outputs

L1 flags formulas with deterministic smells (existential implication, free variables, arity clashes, vacuity, trivial formulas, dangling predicates). On track L, the true positive rate is 2.0% at a false positive rate of 0.4%, giving AUROC 0.508. This is a negative result: L1 lint does not transfer from human annotation errors (where it is effective, AUROC 0.655) to LLM outputs. The reason is that LLM-generated formulas rarely contain the syntactic pathologies L1 detects; their errors are semantic (wrong predicates, missing conditions, scope mistakes).

All nine individual smell rules have false-alarm rates below 3% on every system:

| Smell | gpt-3.5 FA | gpt-4 FA | davinci-003 FA |
|---|---|---|---|
| EX_IMP | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| ALL_AND | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| IFF_RESTR | 0.0 | 0.009 | 0.0 |
| GLUE | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| FREE | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| VACUOUS | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| TRIVIAL | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| ARITY | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| DANGLING | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

Only the FREE smell fires on any track-L errors (4 items).

#### L2 role-aware check: below bag-of-words

The role-aware UD-based check (L2-role) achieves AUROC 0.557, which is 0.18 below the simpler bag-of-words check (L2-bow, 0.737). The role-aware layer adds no discriminative power over word overlap.

#### Decomposed judge ablation

Replacing z3 with an LLM that reads the formula directly (the decomposed judge) drops L3 AUROC from 0.756 to 0.697 (ΔAUROC = −0.059). The LLM gets only 57.6% of binary argument slots correct on track L and 36.4% on track H. The z3 answerer is significantly more accurate for structured formula reading.

#### Per-type sensitivity (track L, at binary threshold)

| Error type | n | L1 | L2-bow | L2-role | L3 | Fused | Cascade |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NEG | 5 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 1.0 |
| QUANT | 2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| CONN | 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| DROP | 142 | 0.028 | 0.479 | 0.127 | 0.197 | 0.599 | 0.606 |
| ADD | 150 | 0.020 | 0.473 | 0.107 | 0.173 | 0.653 | 0.573 |
| SWAP | 12 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.083 | 0.25 | 0.083 | 0.333 |
| BIND | 8 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.375 | 0.25 |
| COMPOUND | 187 | 0.118 | 0.428 | 0.166 | 0.160 | 0.599 | 0.578 |

FOL-Triage is most sensitive to ADD and DROP errors (the largest categories), with the fused score catching about 60%. It misses CONN errors entirely (0/4) and detects SWAP poorly (1/12). Negation errors are fully caught by the cascade (which fires L2-role, where monotonicity shifts are visible) but L1 and L2-bow miss them.

On track H (57 errors), the per-type pattern differs. UNGLUE errors (n = 5) are caught at 100% by L1 and the fused score, because they produce detectable formula smells.

#### Per-type sensitivity (track H)

| Error type | n | L1 | L2-bow | L2-role | L3 | Fused | Cascade |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NEG | 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.25 |
| REV | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| QUANT | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| RESTR | 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| CONN | 8 | 0.25 | 0.125 | 0.0 | 0.375 | 0.375 | 0.375 |
| MOVE | 2 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| DROP | 14 | 0.143 | 0.357 | 0.0 | 0.143 | 0.357 | 0.5 |
| ADD | 19 | 0.158 | 0.368 | 0.053 | 0.211 | 0.526 | 0.579 |
| SWAP | 2 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |
| BIND | 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| UNGLUE | 5 | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| COMPOUND | 33 | 0.303 | 0.182 | 0.242 | 0.182 | 0.545 | 0.636 |

#### Invariance under meaning-preserving rewrites

Five rewrite families were tested on 150 track-L CORRECT items. The table shows the false-alarm rate on the rewritten formula and the flip rate (fraction of items whose binary verdict changes):

| Rewrite | n applies | L1 FA | L1 flip | bow FA | bow flip | role FA | role flip | L3 FA | L3 flip | Fused FA | Fused flip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

The rewrite false-alarm gate (≤ 10% per family) fails. The worst-family fused FA is 0.275 (CONTRAPOSITIVE), but this equals the FA on the original formulas; the flip rate is at most 0.061. The high FA is not caused by the rewrites but by the fused score's calibration: it was fitted on track H where the CORRECT base rate is higher, producing a systematic over-flagging on track L (FA on track-L CORRECT items is 0.194 versus the 0.10 calibration target).

L1, L2-role, and L3 individually pass the 10% gate. L2-bow fails only under RENAME (FA = 0.18), because renaming predicates breaks the bag-of-words match between text and formula.

#### Coverage

| Track | n | Parseable | Full coverage rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| L | 753 | 693 | 0.920 |
| H | 302 | 279 | 0.924 |

Parse rates by system: gpt-3.5-turbo 0.889, gpt-4 0.946, text-davinci-003 0.921. Unparseable outputs are scored as p = 1 (maximum error probability) by the fused metric, so all items receive a score. The coverage gate (≥ 90%) passes.

#### Cost

L1 and L2 are free (CPU-only). L3 costs $0.175 per 1,000 calls with Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite. The total per-item cost is $0.0002, passing the $0.002 gate. CPU time (L1 + L2 + z3): median 35 ms, P95 90 ms. L3 latency: median 630 ms, P95 1.68 s.

#### Contamination check

L3 was run on nonce-disguised sentences (content words replaced by nonsense words) on the full track L. AUROC with exact text-formula alignment: 0.765; with disguised text: 0.770. Paired difference: −0.005 [−0.063, 0.049]. There is no evidence that the LLM benefits from having seen the public benchmark sentences.

#### Complexity strata (track L, fused score)

| Stratum | n (error/correct) | Testable | Fused AUROC | L2-bow AUROC | L3 AUROC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| words < 12 | 443 (179/264) | Yes | 0.781 | 0.742 | 0.772 |
| words 12–19 | 31 (18/13) | No | 0.521 | 0.596 | 0.541 |
| words ≥ 20 | 3 (2/1) | No | 0.500 | 1.000 | 0.000 |
| 0 quantifiers | 302 (130/172) | Yes | 0.743 | 0.728 | 0.771 |
| 1 quantifier | 164 (65/99) | Yes | 0.794 | 0.748 | 0.721 |
| ≥ 2 quantifiers | 11 (4/7) | No | 0.750 | 0.768 | 0.607 |
| depth ≤ 1 | 296 (124/172) | Yes | 0.762 | 0.745 | 0.779 |
| depth 2–3 | 173 (73/100) | Yes | 0.756 | 0.717 | 0.710 |
| depth ≥ 4 | 8 (2/6) | No | 0.667 | 0.750 | 0.500 |
| 0 conditions | 344 (145/199) | Yes | 0.775 | 0.759 | 0.791 |
| 1–2 conditions | 131 (54/77) | Yes | 0.716 | 0.677 | 0.628 |

The frozen screen is dominated by short, simple sentences (93% under 12 words). The long and complex strata (12+ words, 2+ quantifiers, 3+ conditions) have too few items to test. This limitation motivates the held-out dataset (Artifact E), which oversamples these strata.

#### Per-system AUROC (descriptive, n = 3 systems)

| System | n | Error rate | Fused AUROC | L1 AUROC | L2-bow AUROC | L3 AUROC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | 143 | 0.378 | 0.689 | 0.500 | 0.650 | 0.722 |
| gpt-4 | 177 | 0.367 | 0.700 | 0.496 | 0.716 | 0.720 |
| text-davinci-003 | 157 | 0.510 | 0.857 | 0.525 | 0.811 | 0.817 |

FOL-Triage is most discriminative on text-davinci-003, the weakest system. The Kendall τ between system error rates and mean fused scores is 0.333 (3 systems, descriptive only).

#### Label quality observations

The track-L label distribution reveals a systematic issue: 58.8% of typed ERROR items have only ADD+DROP repair operators. On inspection, most of these are vocabulary or arity choices (e.g. Lunch(james) vs HasLunch(james, company)) that the vocabulary aligner cannot bridge. These are likely CORRECT under a looser equivalence definition. The track-H original gold has 27.1% error rate (errors, uncertain, and reading-choice items) and 5.8% unparseable rate. Among non-equivalent parseable items, 21.9% are correct-but-not-equivalent (VOCAB or GRAN class).

### 1.3 Experiment C: Cross-System Consensus

[ARTIFACT:art_i3cVDxBp-USk]

The consensus metric collects translations of the same sentence from multiple independent LLM families, checks pairwise z3 equivalence, and scores each candidate by its disagreement with the pool. Total API spend was $1.52.

#### Headline AUROCs (track L, ERROR vs CORRECT, n = 546, 249 errors)

| Metric | AUROC | 95% CI | AUPRC |
|---|---|---|---|
| c_score (1 − eq_frac, all peers) | 0.866 | [0.821, 0.906] | 0.827 |
| c_score (6 fresh peers only) | 0.872 | [0.830, 0.911] | 0.825 |
| c_score (non-OpenAI peers) | 0.863 | [0.820, 0.903] | 0.808 |
| c_score (2 Logic-LM peers only) | 0.753 | [0.701, 0.806] | 0.659 |
| medoid depth | 0.722 | [0.673, 0.774] | 0.622 |
| cluster entropy | 0.773 | [0.724, 0.820] | 0.691 |
| SC-5 cheap (gpt-4.1-nano) | 0.725 | [0.669, 0.781] | 0.627 |
| SC-5 same model | 0.716 | [0.632, 0.796] | 0.628 |
| SC-5 entropy | 0.631 | [0.568, 0.693] | 0.539 |
| Prediction set instability (SC) | 0.688 | [0.626, 0.750] | 0.602 |
| Prediction set instability (pool) | 0.770 | [0.717, 0.821] | 0.721 |
| FOL length | 0.527 | [0.470, 0.586] | 0.485 |
| Misalignment (vocab) | 0.835 | [0.794, 0.876] | 0.821 |

[FIGURE:fig_consensus_auroc]

The c_score achieves the highest AUROC in the iteration at 0.866. It beats SC-5 (the self-consistency baseline) by ΔAUROC = +0.140 [0.085, 0.197]. Using only the six fresh peer translations (not the three Logic-LM systems) gives 0.872, slightly higher than using all peers. Restricting to the two other Logic-LM systems drops the AUROC to 0.753, showing that diversity across model families is essential.

The misalignment score (0.835) is high because CORRECT items are by construction alignable to the gold in the labeller, so misalignment alone is a strong proxy for error. This does not generalise to settings without a shared vocabulary.

#### RENAME rewrite invariance: failure

Under predicate renaming (replacing predicate names with WordNet synonyms or nonce names), the c_score false-alarm rate is 96% (100% for constant-only renaming). This is expected and fundamental: two formulas with different predicate names are not z3-equivalent, so any rename breaks the equivalence check. The consensus metric is invariant to rewrites that preserve z3 equivalence (reordering, De Morgan, contrapositive) but not to vocabulary changes.

#### Blind-spot analysis

38% of ERROR items are z3-equivalent to the medoid (the most popular peer formula). This places a ceiling on recall of approximately 62%. The blind-spot rate is 5% for polarity errors and 57% for structural errors.

#### Cost

The peer pool costs $0.0015 per sentence (6 peers via API). Total experiment spend: $1.52. z3 pairwise equivalence checking is free.

### 1.4 Experiment D: Disguised Judge and Baselines

[ARTIFACT:art_elDZY26Pu6GD]

This experiment establishes the bar: every baseline metric and every judge variant on the same shared screen, scored with nonce-disguised sentences to control for memorisation. Total API spend was $2.02 (after the OpenRouter key was restored at 15:11 UTC; local judges ran during the outage and are kept as secondary rows).

#### The bar: disguised cheap judge

The primary cheap judge (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, JSON 0–100 scoring, nonce-disguised sentences) achieves AUROC 0.777 [0.720, 0.827] on track L (n = 524, 230 errors, 294 correct).

#### Full baseline table (track L, ERROR vs CORRECT, n = 524)

| Metric | AUROC | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|
| parse_fail | 0.500 | [0.500, 0.500] |
| pilot_joint_conflict | 0.513 | [0.488, 0.539] |

| rt_nli_min_localverb | 0.740 | [0.680, 0.796] |

[FIGURE:fig_baseline_auroc]

#### Pilot structural metrics: negative result

The user's pilot structural metrics are null on this screen. Joint conflict achieves AUROC 0.513, arity inconsistency 0.500, shape inconsistency 0.524, dangling predicates 0.533, and undeclared predicates 0.525. The cross-system predicate-set Jaccard (pilot_rerun_jacc) reaches 0.720, the only pilot metric with signal, but this is a proxy for the consensus approach tested in Experiment C.

#### Round-trip verification

Round-trip NLI (verbalise the formula, compare to the original sentence via bidirectional NLI entailment) achieves AUROC 0.710 [0.648, 0.769]. This is 0.067 below the cheap judge (p = 0.008 by DeLong test). The round-trip reformalisation check (verbalise, re-translate to FOL, check z3 equivalence with the original) achieves only 0.513, because 76% of items tie at the same score.

Round-trip NLI using local verbalisation (the LLM verbalises on the local GPU instead of the API) reaches 0.740 [0.680, 0.796], slightly higher than the API version.

#### Frontier judge

The strong judge (Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview) achieves AUROC 0.802 [0.715, 0.877] on the strong subsample (n = 291). Under disguise it drops to 0.730 [0.655, 0.803]. The ΔAUROC over the cheap judge is +0.024 [−0.075, 0.111], not significant.

#### Cross-fitted baseline combinations (track L)

| Combination | AUROC | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|
| S1 (structural) | 0.698 | [0.634, 0.761] |
| S2 (round-trip) | 0.687 | [0.625, 0.749] |
| S3 (judges disguised) | 0.771 | [0.705, 0.831] |
| S4 (all cheap features) | 0.817 | [0.762, 0.867] |
| S6 (S4 + local judges) | 0.810 | [0.753, 0.861] |

S4 (all cheap features combined via cross-fitted logistic regression) achieves 0.817. This is +0.039 [−0.010, 0.087] over the cheap judge alone, not significant, but it sets the empirical ceiling for cheap baselines.

#### Contamination analysis

No evidence of contamination was found for any judge. The difference-in-differences (DiD) test compares the disguise effect on track H (where the LLM could have memorised public gold) to track L (where it evaluates its own outputs, not memorisable). All DiD CIs include zero:

| Judge | DiD (H − L) | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|
| flash-lite | −0.042 | [−0.170, 0.094] |
| gpt-4.1-nano | −0.077 | [−0.188, 0.023] |
| gemini-3.1-pro | +0.002 | [−0.115, 0.104] |
| Qwen3-8B | −0.045 | [−0.161, 0.079] |
| Llama-3.1-8B | +0.023 | [−0.112, 0.157] |
| Qwen3-14B | −0.073 | [−0.195, 0.056] |

The gold-recall probe confirms this: when the primary model translates track-H sentences from scratch, it matches the corrected gold 15.9% of the time but the original (public) gold only 4.4%. Predicate-name Jaccard with the original gold minus Jaccard with the Logic-LM GPT-4 output is −0.068 [−0.171, 0.034]; the model is not reproducing the public gold.

#### Invariance of judges under meaning-preserving rewrites

Judges are highly sensitive to meaning-preserving rewrites. The FA on CONTRAPOSITIVE rewrites is 0.67 for the cheap judge (original), 0.51 for the cheap judge (disguised), and 0.95 for the cheap2 judge. This compares poorly to FOL-Triage's fused flip rate of 0.0 on CONTRAPOSITIVE.

The full invariance table (track L CORRECT items, n = 270):

| Metric | RENAME flip | REORDER flip | DEMORGAN flip | CONTRA flip | ALL flip |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| judge_cheap_orig | 0.27 | 0.12 | 0.23 | 0.64 | 0.29 |
| judge_cheap_disg | 0.44 | 0.12 | 0.46 | 0.41 | 0.39 |
| judge_cheap2_orig | 0.49 | 0.12 | 0.46 | 0.95 | 0.49 |
| rt_nli_min | 0.37 | 0.10 | 0.31 | 0.33 | 0.31 |
| rt_embed_cos | 0.57 | 0.07 | 0.44 | 0.38 | 0.44 |
| FOL-Triage fused | 0.013 | 0.0 | 0.061 | 0.0 | 0.013 |

FOL-Triage has the lowest flip rate of any metric tested. Judges and round-trip methods change their verdict on 29–49% of meaning-preserving rewrites.

#### Per-error-type sensitivity of judges (track H, curator view, n = 46 errors)

| Group | n | judge_cheap_orig | judge_cheap_disg | judge_cheap2_orig | rt_nli_min |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-op errors | 13 | 0.308 | 0.538 | 0.462 | 0.231 |
| 2-op errors | 11 | 0.545 | 0.818 | 0.727 | 0.273 |
| ADD | 12 | 0.500 | 0.750 | 0.667 | 0.250 |
| COMPOUND | 22 | 0.545 | 0.864 | 0.773 | 0.273 |
| DROP | 11 | 0.455 | 0.636 | 0.455 | 0.182 |
| CONN | 3 | 0.667 | 0.667 | 1.000 | 0.333 |
| NEG | 2 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 1.000 | 0.500 |
| SWAP | 2 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.500 | 0.000 |

The disguised judge is more sensitive than the original judge for most error types, suggesting that nonce disguise forces the model to read more carefully.

#### Judge error-type classification accuracy

The judge's ability to name the correct error type is poor. On track-H 1-op errors, it identifies the correct repair operator 0% of the time (0/12). On 2-op errors, it is correct 45% (5/11). On track L, accuracy is 20% for 1-op and 27% for 2-op errors.

#### Complexity analysis (track L)

A logistic regression of judge correctness on standardised word count yields a coefficient of −0.48 (SE 0.11, p < 0.001): the judge is significantly less reliable on longer sentences. On track H (where longer sentences are available), the coefficient is −0.14 (SE 0.17, p = 0.41), consistent in direction but underpowered.

| Stratum | n (err/cor) | judge_cheap_disg AUROC | rt_nli_min AUROC |
|---|---|---|---|
| words < 12 | 485 (210/275) | 0.784 | 0.713 |
| words 12–19 | 36 (18/18) | 0.667 | 0.670 |
| quantifiers 0–1 | 512 (226/286) | 0.784 | 0.712 |
| depth ≤ 3 | 466 (199/267) | 0.781 | 0.702 |
| depth 4–5 | 54 (30/24) | 0.762 | 0.828 |
| 0 conditions | 394 (182/212) | 0.783 | 0.745 |
| 1–2 conditions | 128 (48/80) | 0.765 | 0.653 |

#### System-level descriptive statistics (3 systems, descriptive only)

| System | True error rate | Judge flag rate | rt_nli_min mean | Parse failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | 0.415 | 0.444 | 0.516 | 26/248 |
| gpt-4 | 0.385 | 0.362 | 0.496 | 10/282 |
| text-davinci-003 | 0.527 | 0.553 | 0.663 | 20/266 |

#### API outage and robustness

The shared OpenRouter key was exhausted at 13:29 UTC and restored at 15:11 UTC. During the outage, all LLM judges ran on the local RTX 4000 Ada GPU with the same prompts (Qwen3-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-14B-nf4). After the key was restored, the API judges were run and designated as primary; the local judges are kept as secondary rows. The local Qwen3-8B judge achieves AUROC 0.757 (disguised), comparable to the API flash-lite judge at 0.777.

### 1.5 Iteration 1 Summary

The four candidates and the bar:

| Method | AUROC | 95% CI | n | Cost/item | Rewrite flip rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| c_score (consensus) | 0.866 | [0.821, 0.906] | 546 | $0.0015/sent | 96% (RENAME) |
| S4 baseline combo | 0.817 | [0.762, 0.867] | 524 | varies | varies |
| **Bar: judge_cheap_disg** | **0.777** | **[0.720, 0.827]** | **524** | **$0.00004** | **0.39** |
| FOL-Triage fused | 0.759 | [0.695, 0.825] | 477 | $0.0002 | 0.013 |
| rt_nli_min | 0.710 | [0.648, 0.769] | 524 | $0.00001 | 0.31 |
| L1 lint | 0.508 | [0.499, 0.519] | 477 | $0 | 0.0 |
| Pilot structural | 0.50–0.53 | n/a | 524 | $0 | n/a |

[FIGURE:fig_summary_comparison]

**What iteration 1 established:**

1. The cross-system consensus metric (c_score = 1 − eq_frac) achieves the highest AUROC at 0.866, beating SC-5 by +0.140. It requires peer translations from multiple model families and is fundamentally non-invariant to predicate renaming (96% FA under RENAME).

2. The disguised cheap judge sets the bar at AUROC 0.777. The S4 combination of all cheap features reaches 0.817 (+0.039, not significant). The frontier judge (Gemini 3.1 Pro) adds nothing significant over the cheap judge.

3. FOL-Triage achieves AUROC 0.759, below the bar. Its primary value is invariance: the fused flip rate under meaning-preserving rewrites is 0.013, compared to 0.29–0.49 for judges. However, the fused false-alarm rate on CORRECT items is 0.194, exceeding the 0.10 calibration target.

4. L1 lint does not transfer from human annotation errors to LLM outputs. The pilot structural metrics are null. Round-trip NLI is 0.067 below the judge.

5. The evaluation labels are noisy: 58.8% of track-L "errors" are pure ADD+DROP (likely vocabulary mismatches). Iteration 2 will re-evaluate under panel-adjudicated labels from the held-out set.

6. No contamination was detected for any LLM-based metric.

**What remains for iteration 2:** (a) Re-evaluate all candidates under adjudicated labels from Artifact E. (b) Compute the paired ΔAUROC between FOL-Triage and the disguised judge on shared items. (c) Test whether combining the consensus metric with FOL-Triage or the judge produces a significant improvement. (d) Confirm on the held-out set.

## Related Work

**NL-FOL datasets and their quality.** FOLIO [1] provides 1,435 FOL-annotated NLI problems. MALLS [2] uses GPT-4 to generate and verify NL-FOL pairs at scale. Brunello et al. [4] found that approximately 42% of entries in both datasets contain incorrect FOL formalisations, with additional ambiguity rates of 17.8% (FOLIO) and 51% (MALLS). Their LLM-assisted re-labelling framework reduces human effort by 5–15× compared to exhaustive review. Logic-LM [10] prompts LLMs for FOL and calls a prover, releasing outputs that we use as our evaluation screen.

**FOL closeness metrics.** Thatikonda et al. [5] evaluate n-gram, graph, embedding, and LLM-based metrics on controlled FOL perturbations, finding that no single metric is sensitive to all perturbation types. Smatch++ is the most sensitive to quantifier changes, while BL-score responds most to negation. Their work measures sensitivity to synthetic perturbations; ours measures faithfulness prediction on real LLM outputs with noisy labels.

**NL-FOL error taxonomies.** Thatikonda et al. [6] propose a verification pipeline with a 28-category error taxonomy. Brunello et al. [4] classify errors into semantic and structural categories. Our typed repair operators (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE) follow the same tradition but are derived from z3 equivalence-class differences rather than manual annotation.

**Factuality metrics.** FRANK [11] defines a typology of factuality errors in abstractive summarisation and evaluates correlation of automatic metrics with human judgments. QuestEval [13] uses question generation and answering to assess factual consistency. QAGS [12] similarly generates questions from a summary and checks whether the source answers them the same way. Our L3 questionnaire layer is closest to this family: it generates structured questions from the text and checks the formula's answers via z3, rather than using another LLM.

**Round-trip and self-consistency.** Amrollahi et al. [7] propose verbalising a formal statement back to natural language and checking consistency, reporting high accuracy on mathematical autoformalization. Li et al. [8] use symbolic equivalence and semantic consistency for Lean/Isabelle autoformalization. Our round-trip baseline follows the same pattern but achieves only AUROC 0.710 on NL-FOL, below the LLM judge.

**Monotonicity and polarity.** SyGNS [14] tests monotonicity reasoning in NLI models. Udep2Mono [15] computes monotonicity profiles from Universal Dependencies. Our L2 role-aware layer attempted to use monotonicity-aware comparisons but achieved AUROC 0.557, a negative result.

**Counter-interpretation methods.** CLOVER [9] generates counter-interpretations to test logical validity via an LLM oracle. Our consensus approach is related in spirit: it uses multiple independent translations as implicit counter-proposals, but relies on z3 equivalence rather than LLM-generated counterexamples.

**Vacuity detection.** Kupferman and Vardi [16] formalise vacuity in temporal logic model checking. Our L1 lint layer includes a vacuity check (detecting formulas where a subformula can be replaced by its negation without changing the truth value), adapted from their framework.

STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

The previous review is BLOCKING: the paper must not ship as it stands. Every MUST-FIX item below is a requirement for this iteration, not a suggestion — an iteration that leaves one unaddressed does not publish.

- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The report's description of dataset E's panel contradicts the dataset card. The report says the 173-item calibration 'shows that the panel agrees with expert-corrected labels on both faithful and unfaithful items'. The dataset card (gen_art_dataset_1/dataset_card.md, headline facts 2–3, §4) says something else. The panel accepts only 0.613 of expert-CORRECTED formulas and reaches about 0.727 majority accuracy on real errors. It judged 440/535 (0.822) of MALLS gold and 112/148 CTRL references unfaithful, against 36–46% for expert audits. The card warns that 'ERROR is over-called'. The report also says labels come from 'z3 equivalence to audited gold', but 3,891 of 8,507 rows are tier C (no trusted reference, panel-only) and only 1,044 are tier A.
  Action: Replace the sentence with the card's numbers: acceptance 0.613 on expert-corrected, 0.727 on real errors, 0.822 MALLS-gold rejection vs 36–46% for experts, and tier counts A 1,044 / B 2,157 / C 3,891 / none 276 / UNPARSEABLE 1,086. Add the §4 gold-audit table and state that tier-A-only confirmation is mandatory in iteration 2. Mark it as a correction in place.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) The iteration's comparative conclusion is not supported by a head-to-head test. §1.5 ranks c_score 0.866 (n=546), S4 0.817 (n=524), judge 0.777 (n=524) and FOL-Triage 0.759 (n=477), but the four figures come from three different label vectors. Exp A has 278 CORRECT/199 ERROR on 753 track-L items, exp C 297/249 on 867, and exp D 294/230 on 796; only 588 ids are shared, and 16 GRAN items are CORRECT in D but UNCERTAIN in A and C. The pre-registered rule requires a paired Δ vs the disguised judge with a CI excluding 0, and that was never computed. My paired sentence-clustered bootstrap on the 389 common, label-consistent items (160 errors, 151 sentences) gives c_score 0.842 vs judge 0.785, Δ +0.057 [−0.022, 0.137], not significant, and fused 0.767, Δ −0.020 [−0.111, 0.074]. Files: review_report/audit/paired_boot.json and join_audit.json.
  Action: Add a 'Common-item comparison' table with every candidate, the judge and S4 on the shared label-consistent ids, using paired bootstrap Δs and exp D's data/folds.json. State that under the pre-registered rule c_score fails both the Δ-vs-judge criterion on shared items and the rewrite-FA ≤10% gate (RENAME FA 96%). FOL-Triage fails Δ-vs-judge and rewrite FA. So the iteration-1 verdict is 'no candidate passes; judge is the incumbent'.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The adjudicated screen labels already exist and reverse the ranking, but the report defers them to iteration 2. Dataset E (this iteration) wrote screen_adjudicated_labels.json keyed by the same item_id. Re-scoring with it (review_report/audit/rescore_adjudicated.json) gives, on tier A+B, track L, n=304 with 170 errors: fused 0.872, l2_bow 0.817, c_score 0.776, judge_cheap_disg 0.771, rt_nli_min 0.750, sc5 0.699. On all tiers (n=504) the order is fused 0.868, c_score 0.829, judge 0.815. The consensus metric's lead disappears once labels no longer come from the same align() that c_score uses. This is exactly the shared-aligner confound exp C's README flags, which the report mentions only for the 'misalign' probe. The panel's known strictness (above) means this re-score also needs caveats, but it cannot simply be left out.
  Action: Add a subsection 'Re-score under dataset-E adjudicated screen labels'. Include tier A+B, tier A only and all-tier tables with paired CIs, and state that the iteration-1 ranking is label-dependent. In exp C's section, state that c_score and the solver labeller share align(), and report the vocab-clean control (c_score 0.852 [0.765, 0.929] vs SC 0.714, 82 errors) and the partial Spearman of 0.51.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The report's statements about the screen audit and ADD+DROP labels contradict the audit itself. It says a 1,173-item screen audit 'confirms the label assignment', and that 58.8% of track-L ERRORs are ADD+DROP and 'likely CORRECT under a looser equivalence definition'. The dataset card §11 shows the panel disagrees with the auto label on 14/48 auto-CORRECT and 14/74 auto-ERROR items, splits 76 FAITHFUL / 70 UNFAITHFUL on VOCAB_GRAN, and calls 178/220 COMPOUND items unfaithful. Joining the adjudicated labels to exp D's track L gives 58 CORRECT→ERROR and only 1 ERROR→CORRECT (12 CONTESTED); exp C gives 62 and 1. Label noise runs mainly the opposite way from what the report asserts: vocabulary-aligned 'CORRECT' items are often unfaithful.
  Action: Replace both claims with the audit's actual cross-tab (auto label × panel majority) and the label-transition counts. Flag the 'VOCAB = CORRECT' convention used by all three experiments as the larger label risk. Keep the original sentence struck through with a correction note.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The report's claim that the frontier judge 'adds nothing significant' contradicts exp D. The report cites +0.024 [−0.075, 0.111], a row of the paired_vs_judge_cheap_disg table that does not compare like with like. analysis.json['paired_strong_subset'] and exp D's README ('The frontier judge beats the cheap judge on the same items') give strong_orig − cheap_orig = +0.077 [0.006, 0.154], DeLong p=0.015, on the 200-item L subset (68 errors). On H the strong subset gives +0.115 (p=0.003) and +0.148 vs cheap_disg (p=0.003), and H_curator_view AUROC is 0.915. The report also gives the subset as n=291; it is 200 L items (plus 96 H). The gap vanishes under disguise, and the frontier judge costs $0.0029 per call, above the $0.002 gate. Those are the facts the record needs.
  Action: Replace the paragraph with the same-item paired results for both tracks and both conditions, correct n to 200, and note that the frontier judge fails the cost gate. The user asked whether a large judge 'earns its cost', so state that it adds discrimination on original text but not under disguise.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (scope) Candidate B is a dead end the report never mentions. gen_strat_1 and gen_plan_experiment_2 planned 'verbalise-and-entail' B1 (template, non-repairing English with bidirectional DeBERTa NLI) and B2 (z3-built finite worlds separating the candidate from its typed mutants, judged TRUE/FALSE/UNDETERMINED from text only, with UNDETERMINED pre-registered as the dropped-condition signal). gen_art_experiment_2 contains only an empty .aii folder. The report lists B among the candidates, then silently substitutes exp D's LLM-verbaliser round-trip baseline, which is a different method. B2 was the one candidate aimed at dropped conditions in long sentences, the user's priority.
  Action: Add '1.x Candidate B: planned, not executed'. Summarise the B1/B2 plan and give the reason it did not run (check the run logs for a slot failure, budget or time). State that the round-trip rows in exp D are an LLM-verbaliser baseline, not B1. Record in 'What remains' whether B is dropped or carried to iteration 2.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Tables on disk are missing from the report. From exp D (results/summary.md): the H_primary (n=177) and H_curator_view (n=199) AUROC tables for all 27 metrics; L_exclude_subst_only (judge 0.760, rt_nli 0.671); L_unparseable_as_error, where parse_fail is 0.598, the only view in which the user's parse-rate baseline has meaning; L_borderline_to_uncertain and L_pessimistic label-robustness views; the full invariance table with base→rewrite FA and REPRINT; the paired Δ-vs-judge table with DeLong p; the H complexity table (≥20 words, ≥3 conditions cells exist on H); coverage per metric; and cost per component. From exp A: secondary sets ERROR∪COMPOUND and minus-ADD+DROP (fused 0.731 < L3 0.776 once artefacts are removed); binary-layer TPR/FPR/precision@prevalence; the L3 HREF field gate (force 0.69 excluded); fusion coefficients; test-retest (0.917 exact JSON); qwen3-30b second-model row; track-H same-text paired AUROC. From exp C: lenient (0.882), vocab-strict (0.875), track H (0.832), the multi-family secondary sample (n=1,686, 0.825, every family 0.81–0.85), cross-fitted [c_score, sc5] +0.147, cluster-entropy and predset Δs, precision at 10%/25% prevalence, and the RENAME breakdown (pred-only 84%, const-only 100%, flip 77%, base FA 19%).
  Action: Transcribe each of these tables into the relevant experiment subsection with its source file path (results/summary.md, results/RESULTS.md, results/summary.json). Where space is a concern, keep them in an 'Iteration 1 supplementary tables' block. The paper step can only publish what is here.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (scope) The report covers only part of the user's request. (a) The long, heavily conditioned stratum the user said 'matters most' is untestable on the screen (93% of items are under 12 words; 0 errors with ≥3 conditions) and no metric was run on dataset E. The report says this but draws iteration-1 conclusions as if they generalise. (b) Error-type identification is reported only for the judge (0–27%). Exp A's readout (P(code ∈ true ops | fired) = 0.326, L1 hit 0.857 on 7) and exp C's medoid-repair operator match (81% vs 46% chance; coarse class 92% vs 78%) are omitted, although they are the only positive evidence on 'which kind of error'. (c) System-level correlation is given only across 3 systems. Exp C's 9-system Spearman of 0.87 is omitted. (d) Dataset E's correct-but-not-equivalent rates (0.16–0.26 per stratum, 0.07–0.43 per system) and gold-error rates, which the user explicitly asked to be estimated, are omitted. (e) The deliverable 'reusable Python functions with a precise statement of what each measures' is not listed. The function names exist in the artifacts (src/fol_triage.py: fol_lint, content_accounting, role_accounting, role_questionnaire, l3_compare; src/consensus.py: score_candidate, sc_scores).
  Action: Add a 'Coverage against the request' table: requirement, where it is answered (section/file), status. Add the error-typing results of exps A and C, the 9-system correlation, dataset E's §4–5 tables, and a function inventory with a one-line definition for each.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (clarity) The reasoning behind the candidates is not recorded. The report opens at the iteration-1 screen with no account of the three pre-loop hypothesis/review rounds that produced FOL-Triage. It leaves out the iter-3 probe evidence (L1 flagged 27% of real errors at 1.7% FA on 99 curated pairs; bag-of-words paired AUROC 0.59 failed the gate, motivating L3). It also leaves out the reviewer's objections: about 10/24 ADD/DROP census rows are conventions; COMPOUND is a depth-2 search failure; the ⊕/→ precedence bug had to be fixed; and prior art for typed repair and guard smells (Vehlken/Zeume et al., KR 2026, arXiv 2602.19673). Without these, the paper step cannot explain why L1 was expected to work and why its failure on LLM outputs matters.
  Action: Add a short 'Iteration 0 / how we got here' block. Cover the hypothesis claim and probe numbers, the review score and objections, how the strategy answered each objection (the shared screen, the ⊕ fix, the decision rule including 'judge wins if nothing beats it and AUROC ≥ .75'), and why candidates A–D and dataset E were chosen.
- [MINOR] (rigor) Some invariance claims are mislabelled or overclaimed. The FOL-Triage row's 'ALL flip 0.013' has no source: exp A reports no ALL aggregate, and 0.013 is its RENAME flip. FOL-Triage and the judges were evaluated on different rewrite sets (exp A: 150 items, 40 contrapositive; exp D: 270 items, 39 contrapositive). The claim that FOL-Triage 'has the lowest flip rate of any metric tested' is false: L1, parse_fail and pilot_arity are 0.0, and c_score is 0 on all z3-equivalent rewrites. The summary table puts c_score's FA (96%) in the flip-rate column; its RENAME flip is 77%.
  Action: Correct the cells, name each rewrite set, and either run FOL-Triage on exp D's data/invariance_items.json or state that the comparison is across different rewrite samples.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The report says the disguised judge is 'more sensitive … suggesting nonce disguise forces the model to read more carefully', but it compares recall at thresholds with very different false-alarm rates. judge_cheap_disg has FA 0.229 vs 0.059 for orig on H_curator_view, and 0.129 vs 0.034 on L. Higher recall at a looser operating point is not better reading. Separately, the statement that 'z3 answerer is significantly more accurate' is tautological, because the LLM is scored against z3's exact answers.
  Action: Report recall at matched FA (or per-type AUROC), and delete the 'reads more carefully' interpretation unless it survives. Rephrase the z3 statement as 'the LLM reproduces z3's exact formula reading on 57.6% (L) / 36.4% (H) of argument slots'.
- [MINOR] (rigor) 'No contamination was detected for any LLM-based metric' is stated without power. The DiD CIs are about ±0.13 wide (e.g. flash-lite −0.042 [−0.170, 0.094]), so a contamination effect of 0.1 AUROC cannot be excluded. The report also omits that gpt-4.1-nano loses significantly under disguise on track H (−0.114 [−0.207, −0.032]) and H_curator (−0.102 [−0.176, −0.033]).
  Action: State the minimum detectable DiD and list the significant single-track disguise drops, with the artifact's interpretation (lost lexical meaning vs memorisation).
- [MINOR] (novelty) The report's one positive, non-obvious claim (cross-family consensus beats sampling self-consistency by +0.14) is not compared with its nearest published neighbours. SAC3 (Zhang et al., EMNLP Findings 2023, arXiv 2311.01740) already shows cross-model consistency outperforms self-consistency for hallucination detection. Li et al. (NeurIPS 2024) use symbolic equivalence across samples for autoformalization. FormalAlign (ICLR 2025) is a gold-free alignment scorer for autoformalization that is neither cited nor compared. The report needs to state what this run adds beyond them: z3-modulo-vocabulary equivalence on NL→FOL, the typed medoid repair, and the blind-spot analysis.
  Action: Add a two-line nearest-neighbour note under exp C naming SAC3, Li et al. 2024 and FormalAlign, and stating what is new here. Treat 'consensus > SC' as confirming SAC3, not as a new finding.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Bookkeeping inconsistencies. The Framing says the screen has 796 items and that track H's 294 items include 57 errors. 796/294 are exp D's counts; 57 is exp A's ERROR+UNCERTAIN positives (exp D has 35 ERROR, exp C 35). The ~42% gold-error rate is cited to [3] in the Framing and to [4] in Related Work, while the dataset card cites 2606.02837 at about 36–39%. The dataset spend of $9.83 exceeded its $9.50 hard cap. The 11 judge JSON failures that are flagged rather than dropped (0.777 vs 0.785) are not mentioned.
  Action: Give per-experiment n and label sha in one table, fix the citation, record the budget overshoot, and note how the judge JSON failures were handled.

<pipeline_steps>
STEP 2 — STRATEGY: The pipeline's strategy generator (gen_strat) read the reviewer feedback
and designed a new research strategy to address the critiques.

STEP 3 — PLANNING: The planner (gen_plan) turned the strategy into concrete artifact plans —
specific experiments, datasets, or research tasks to execute.

STEP 4 — EXECUTION: The executor (gen_art) ran those plans and produced the new artifacts
shown in <new_artifacts_this_iteration> below.
</pipeline_steps>

<results_status>
This iteration executed at least one EXPERIMENT/EVALUATION/PROOF with real output: gen_art_experiment_5, gen_art_evaluation_1.
Report their concrete findings in full, tables included.

PROVENANCE: every claim that rests on an artifact carries an [ARTIFACT:id] marker at its
FIRST mention (see ARTIFACT REFERENCES below). Markers already present in <previous_report>
stay: carry each one through unchanged, and add one to any claim that still lacks it. A
report with executed artifacts and zero [ARTIFACT:id] markers is INCOMPLETE and will be
sent back.

  CORRECTED RECORD OF ITERATION 1 (it replaces the draft's claims; every number was executed).
  (i) Under the pre-registered rule, NO candidate passed. The disguised cheap judge (gemini-2.5-flash-lite, nonce-disguised, AUROC 0.777) is the incumbent. On the 389 common, label-consistent track-L items (160 errors, 151 sentences; review audit paired_boot.json), c_score is 0.842 vs the judge's 0.785, Δ +0.057 [-0.022, 0.137]; FOL-Triage fused is 0.767, Δ -0.020 [-0.111, 0.074]. c_score also fails the rewrite gate (RENAME false alarms 96%, flip 77%).
  (ii) The ranking depends on the labels. Re-scoring with dataset E's adjudicated screen labels (screen_adjudicated_labels.json; review audit rescore_adjudicated.json), tier A+B, n=304 with 170 errors: fused (fitted on track H only, never on these labels) 0.872, L2-bow 0.817, c_score 0.776, judge 0.771, rt_nli 0.750, SC-5 0.699. All tiers (n=504): fused 0.868, c_score 0.829, judge 0.815. Label noise runs mostly one way: vocabulary-aligned 'CORRECT' is often unfaithful. Solver-CORRECT to panel-ERROR is 58 (exp D) / 62 (exp C), against 1 and 1 the other way. So the 'VOCAB = CORRECT' convention is the largest label risk, not ADD+DROP artefacts.
  (iii) Two shared-instrument confounds point in opposite directions. c_score shares align() with the solver labeller, although its vocab-clean control holds (0.852 vs SC 0.714; partial Spearman 0.51). L2-bow shares lexical sensitivity with the panel, since both penalise unanchored predicates. Neither label regime alone can rank these metrics.
  (iv) Closed in iteration 1; one sentence each in the paper, no further budget. L1 lint on LLM outputs: AUROC 0.508, TPR 2% (it works on human errors, 0.655, and as a gold audit). L2-role: 0.557. The user's pilot structural metrics: 0.50-0.53, a clean negative. Round-trip re-formalise-and-z3: 0.513.
  (v) Frontier judge (gemini-3.1-pro), same items: +0.077 [0.006, 0.154] over the cheap judge on 200 original-text L items (p=.015), and +0.115 on H. The gain vanishes under disguise. It costs $0.0029 per call, above the $0.002 gate.
  (vi) Judges are not rewrite-invariant. They flip on 29-49% of meaning-preserving rewrites (contrapositive false alarms: cheap 0.67, nano 0.95).
  (vii) Consensus is cross-family (6 fresh peers 0.872 vs 2 Logic-LM peers 0.753) and beats SC-5 by +0.140. That result CONFIRMS SAC3 (Zhang et al. 2023); it is not new.
  (viii) Exact-equivalence consensus degrades with length: its complexity interaction is -0.94 per SD of words, vs about 0 for SC.
  (ix) Candidate B (B1 template-verbalise + bidirectional NLI; B2 solver-built worlds judged from text) was PLANNED BUT NEVER EXECUTED. gen_art_experiment_2 is empty, and exp D's round-trip rows are an LLM-verbaliser baseline, not B1.
  (x) Dataset E's panel is STRICT: it accepts 0.613 of expert-corrected formulas, has 0.727 majority accuracy on real errors, and rejects 0.822 of MALLS gold vs 36-46% for experts. Tiers: A 1,044 / B 2,157 / C 3,891 / none 276 / UNPARSEABLE 1,086. In L25, tier-A-only is NOT testable (40 CORRECT / 98 ERROR).

  CLAIM (the lead, made bigger and cleaner). COMPLEMENTARY GOLD-FREE FUSION, called PEER+TEXT. Two cheap, judge-free signals see disjoint parts of the error mass. Fused with fixed weights, they beat the disguised cheap LLM judge AND the best cross-fitted combination of all requested baselines. They do so under EVERY label regime, on held-out data. The advantage is largest on long, heavily conditioned sentences, where the judge degrades, and the fused metric stays invariant to meaning-preserving rewrites that flip the judge.
  Signal 1, STRUCTURE-FROM-PEERS: graded, name-free cross-family consensus. It sees structural, scope, quantifier and polarity errors that a candidate's family makes and others do not: the polarity blind spot is 5%, and recall on polarity errors 0.95.
  Signal 2, LEXICON-AND-ROLES-FROM-TEXT: L2 text accounting plus the L3 text-only role questionnaire, answered exactly by z3 on the formula side. It sees errors that ALL systems share, and meaning-changing renames, where consensus is blind: 38% of errors are endorsed by the peer medoid (COVERAGE 41%, STRUCT 57%).
  A cheap judge reads both kinds of error but loses them on long inputs and under rewrites.
  One-sentence finding if it holds: 'For NL->FOL there is no need for a large judge. Agreement among cheap translators, checked by a solver clause by clause, plus solver-exact text accounting, beats an LLM judge and every standard baseline combination. It stays rewrite-invariant, and it holds on long conditioned sentences regardless of how the labels were adjudicated.'

  MECHANISM PREDICTIONS (pre-registered; informative whichever way they fall).
  P1 CROSSOVER. Per-type recall at matched false-alarm rate: peers > text on QUANT/SCOPE/BIND/argument-SWAP/NEG, and text > peers on MEANING_RENAME and on peer-endorsed (medoid-equivalent) errors.
  P2 DISJOINTNESS. Among true errors, Spearman(peer score, text score) < 0.4. At least 50% of the fusion's AUROC gain over the better single signal comes from peer-endorsed errors.
  P3 LENGTH. Exact-equivalence consensus loses AUROC with words (interaction < 0), graded consensus loses at most half as much, and the judge's correctness falls with length (iteration 1: -0.48 per SD, p<.001). The fused-minus-judge Δ is therefore larger in L25/L20/EXC than in CTRL.
  P4 INVARIANCE. PEER+TEXT stays ≤10% false alarms on EVERY rewrite family, including RENAME, on one shared rewrite set. The judges stay at ≥25% on at least one family.

  COMPONENT FIXES. Each defect is fixed once; a component that breaks again is dropped.
  F1 NAME-FREE ALIGNMENT, for the RENAME 96% false alarms and the align() confound. Candidate-to-peer predicate and constant maps are found from structure, not names. Signature per symbol: arity, z3 monotonicity (DOWN/UP), quantifier-block position and argument-sharing graph, plus an optional text anchor (the L2 stem/WordNet span). The search is an assignment, accepted only if clause entailment verifies under it. This makes consensus invariant to renaming by construction and decouples it from the labeller's name-similarity aligner. Over-alignment risk (masking predicate substitution) is measured by per-type recall of SWAP and MEANING_RENAME.
  F2 GRADED CLAUSE CONSENSUS, for length saturation.
    - Decompose every formula into claim units: top-level conjuncts after normalisation, each universal rule as (restrictor set, consequent), and existential claims.
    - support = the mean over the candidate's units of the fraction of peers p for which p entails the unit.
    - coverage = the fraction of peer-majority units (units supported by ≥50% of peers) that the candidate entails.
    - g_score = 1 - F1(support, coverage).
    - The same z3 calls give the error type and location. An unsupported unit is ADD. An uncovered majority unit is DROP (the dropped-condition signal the user cares about most). A candidate that entails the negation of a majority unit is NEG. A unit that matches only after a quantifier flip is QUANT. The medoid-repair operator readout (81% exact operator match vs 46% chance in iteration 1) is kept for the error code.
    - Peers are leave-one-FAMILY-out. Gold-as-system and ccg2lambda rows are never peers. Timeouts are UNKNOWN units, and their number is reported.
  F3 FUSION CALIBRATION, for the false-alarm rate on CORRECT items (0.19 vs a 0.10 target). The logistic is over [g_score, exact c_score, L2-bow, L3-z3]. It is fitted ONLY on the screen (track L+H), on items where the solver label and the adjudicated screen label AGREE, so that neither shared-instrument confound drives the weights. The threshold is set on screen CORRECT items from LLM systems only. Weights and threshold are frozen in prereg before any held-out label is read.
  F4 CANDIDATE B2, executed once (it was never tested, not refuted). z3 builds small worlds that separate the candidate from its typed single-edit mutants. Each world is verbalised by template, and a cheap text-only reader answers TRUE/FALSE/UNDETERMINED from the sentence. It is capped at $2 and screened as a standalone metric and as a 5th fusion feature. If it fails to run again, it is dropped for good.

  LABEL REGIMES. The claim counts only if it survives all of them; labels are never judged by the metric.
  R_AB: dataset E tiers A+B, excluding CONTESTED and reading_choice (the card's primary pool).
  R_A: tier A only, solver vs audited/repaired reference. It is testable in L20 and EXC; sign-only elsewhere.
  R_ADJ: a NEW calibrated, reference-aware adjudicator.
    - A frontier family that is neither a generator nor a metric judge (Anthropic Sonnet-class) sees the sentence, the candidate and the reference.
    - It adjudicates a stratified sample of ≤1,200 E rows: every solver-vs-panel disagreement, and tier-B and L25 rows over-sampled.
    - It also adjudicates the ~70 screen disagreement items.
    - Gate: balanced accuracy ≥0.85 on the 96 expert track-H pairs + 77 gate items, separately ≥0.80 on faithful and on unfaithful items. If it fails the gate, R_ADJ is dropped and reported.
  R_COMP: a new COMPOSED-LONG stratum whose references are trusted by construction.
    - About 250 sentences of ≥25 words with ≥3 conditions and unless/except/provided-that templates, composed from short references already verified (TRUSTED_AGREED/GOLD_PANEL_OK, FOLIO-refined ∩ DSAVlab agreed). Both weak and strong exception readings are accepted.
    - Candidates come from the same 10 generator slots (real outputs, not perturbations).
    - VOCAB_GRAN rows go to R_ADJ. It is a separate stratum, never pooled with real sentences. It exists because in L25 tier A is untestable and the panel rejects 85% of references.
  The disagreement between regimes is itself reported: how much each metric's AUROC moves between R_AB and R_ADJ, and in which direction.

  SCREEN vs CONFIRMATION (strict).
  SCREEN: track L/H (753 + 302 items) with both label sets. It is used for all fitting, thresholds and fix selection.
  CONFIRMATION: dataset E (700 sentences, 8,507 rows; L25 176C/697E, L20 229/592, EXC 222/384, CTRL 237/149 in A+B), plus R_COMP. It is scored ONCE with frozen weights. If confirmation fails, PEER+TEXT is dead. There will be no subgroup hunting on E.

  BASELINES, run on E with the same item ids (all requested ones):
  - parse rate, with unparseable outputs as errors and in the denominator;
  - the pilot structural metrics;
  - round-trip NLI (API and local verbaliser) and embedding similarity;
  - cheap judge, original and disguised, on all decided rows (about $0.3);
  - frontier judge, original and disguised, on a stratified 300-row subsample (about $1);
  - SC-5 on a stratified 1,500-row subsample;
  - exact c_score;
  - each FOL-Triage layer;
  - S4 = the cross-fitted combination of all cheap baselines INCLUDING the judge, with fold ids by sentence.

  SUCCESS CRITERIA.
  CONFIRM, all three required:
  (a) PEER+TEXT minus judge_cheap_disg, paired sentence-clustered bootstrap: 95% CI > 0 on pooled E under R_AB AND R_ADJ, and the sign is positive under R_A (pooled L20+EXC tier A).
  (b) The nested cross-fitted ΔAUROC of [S4 + PEER+TEXT] over S4 has a CI > 0 under R_AB and R_ADJ.
  (c) In the L25+L20+EXC long stratum and in R_COMP, the Δ vs the judge is positive with CI > 0 in at least one of them. PEER+TEXT is at least 0.95 of the frontier judge's AUROC on the frontier subsample, at ≤10% of its cost.
  PARTIAL: (a) holds in one regime only, or holds pooled but not in the long strata. It is reported as regime-dependent, with the regime-shift table as the finding.
  DISCONFIRM: the CI includes 0 or is negative in every regime. The judge is then the incumbent for the user, and the crossover table (P1) still says which error mass each cheap signal owns.
  The mechanism claims P1-P4 are scored separately, and each is reported CONFIRMED or REFUTED.
  Power: pooled E has about 860 CORRECT and 1,800 ERROR rows over about 600 sentences, so the paired ΔAUROC MDE is about 0.04 pooled and about 0.07 per testable stratum. Strata below 50/50 are declared untestable before scoring.

  THE USER'S OTHER REQUIREMENTS, delivered in the same pass:
  - item-level AUROC/AUPRC and precision at the frozen threshold;
  - system-level Kendall τ with CI over the 13 E system×variant rows (iteration 1 gave Spearman 0.87 over 9 systems, descriptive);
  - per-error-type sensitivity on real errors typed by minimal repair, plus a typed-perturbation suite of tier-A-verified references with the 12 operators at matched positions;
  - error-type identification accuracy: the g_score unit codes and medoid operators vs the adjudicated repair operators, against the judge's 0-27%;
  - one SHARED rewrite set (exp D's invariance_items.json extended with RENAME), run for every metric;
  - coverage with every failure in the denominator;
  - $ and seconds per item;
  - complexity curves over words, quantifiers, depth, conditions and exceptions;
  - contamination: original vs disguised for every LLM component, with the minimum detectable DiD stated;
  - gold-error and correct-but-not-equivalent rates under R_AB vs R_ADJ (iteration-1 R_AB values: correct-but-not-equivalent 0.16-0.26 per stratum and 0.06-0.43 per system; panel gold-error rate 0.82).
  Deliverables: reusable functions, each with a precise docstring: name_free_align, graded_consensus(text, fol, peers) -> {g_score, support, coverage, unit_codes}, content_accounting, role_questionnaire + l3_compare, peer_text_score(text, fol, peers), world_probe (B2); plus the released labelling tools equivalent_modulo_vocab, minimal_typed_repair and the R_ADJ adjudication prompt.
  Error-type census (formerly C2): it is kept as a DESCRIPTIVE by-product on E under R_ADJ (prediction: polarity ≤20% and coverage ≥40% of repaired errors).
  The synthetic-to-real decomposition (formerly C3): it is reported only descriptively, from the typed-perturbation suite, with no separate budget.
motivation: >-
  The user needs to score (text, FOL) pairs with no gold, and has warned that detecting synthetic perturbations is not the
  target. Two in-step facts reshape the design. (1) Real errors are not where perturbation suites look. After vocabulary alignment,
  polarity-type single edits are about 10% of repairable real errors, while a uniform typed suite (our iteration-2 suite:
  3 of 10 operators) spends 30% of its mass on them. Nearly half of real errors are multi-edit restructurings. Coverage (a
  missing condition, an added property) dominates the rest. (2) Real errors split by what is needed to SEE them. About a quarter
  are visible from the formula alone, as shapes almost no English sentence has (∃x(A→B), glued independent claims, a restrictor
  inside ↔, free variables). Those can be flagged with near-zero false alarms, no text, no LLM and no gold, and the check
  cannot be contaminated. The rest need the text, and a bag-of-words check is too weak for them, so role-level accounting
  or a text-only questionnaire is required. This gives the user three things. First, a cheap, deterministic L1 layer that
  flags a known share of errors with a known false-alarm rate, and that also audits gold: it found an error in the curated
  corrected gold. Second, a principled place to spend small-LLM money (L3), only where L1/L2 are blind. Third, a validation
  recipe (census-reweighted typed perturbations) that says when a cheap synthetic test suite can stand in for real labelled
  errors. That matters because gold is rare and partly wrong (about 36-39% of original FOLIO/MALLS gold, per 2606.02837).
  The long, heavily conditioned stratum the user cares about is now labelable. MALLS-train holds 1,501 sentences of at least
  25 words with 3 or more conditions, and 986 exception-bearing sentences of at least 15 words, which replaces the infeasible
  SARA Prolog. That is where the pilot shows both the biggest risk (L1 false alarms rise at 20 words or more) and the biggest
  opportunity: in the pilot census the COMPOUND share of errors rises from 7/27 (26%) under 12 words to 14/24 (58%) at 20
  words or more, exactly the mass that single-invariant checks and typed perturbations miss.
assumptions:
- >-
  Corrected gold anchors real-error labels well enough once it is itself audited. The pilot shows that the curated gold contains
  residual errors: L1 flagged the corrected vaccine formula ∃x(A→B). Automatic vocabulary alignment over-accepts meaning-changing
  renames: 21/99 is an upper bound, and bag-of-words L2 fires on 4 of those 21. So every VOCAB/GRAN and COMPOUND pair, plus
  a 20% sample of the rest, goes to a 3-family adjudication panel on disguised items. The panel's own accuracy is measured
  first on typed perturbations, split by DOWN and UP position. Curator AMBIGUITY flags define a separate 'reading choice'
  label class that is never pooled with errors.
- >-
  Formula smells mined from annotator errors transfer to LLM errors, at least partly. This is the main risk to C1(a). It is
  tested directly: L1 false alarms are measured per family on verified-correct LLM outputs (equivalent to corrected gold modulo
  alignment, or panel-confirmed), and L1 precision on real LLM errors. If a smell exceeds 3% false alarms for any family it
  is dropped, and that is reported, not tuned.
- >-
  A small LLM that reads only the sentence can fill a fixed role schema (condition vs assertion, force, negation, claim grouping,
  argument order) with ≥ 85% per-field accuracy. This is measured on the gold-derived schema answers of verified items before
  L3 is fused. Because L3 never sees a formula, it cannot copy a memorised gold formula. Contamination is still checked by
  comparing original items with disguised items (entities and predicates renamed).
- >-
  Enough labelled long items exist. MALLS-train gives 1,501 items with at least 25 words and 3 conditions, and 4,539 with
  at least 20 words and 3 conditions (probes/complexity_counts.out.txt). Its GPT-4 gold is noisy, so a stratified 600 are
  relabelled by the panel. FOLIO-refined (19 such premises) and ProverQA-hard (0 long conditioned sentences among 8,948) cannot
  fill this stratum. A stratum is tested only if it holds at least 50 errors AND at least 50 correct outputs.
- >-
  The z3 fragment covers the data. 8 of 302 curated corrected formulas fail our parser, and 334 of 27,284 MALLS-train formulas
  fail. Every unparseable output is counted in the denominator as a coverage failure. Timeouts are labelled UNKNOWN and never
  merged with proofs.
investigation_approach: >-
  COMPONENT MAP (layer: target error types; pilot reach on real human errors; calibration status). L1 lint: GLUE/UNGLUE, RESTR,
  BIND/free variable, ∃→ and ↔-restrictor structure, well-formedness; 47% of structural/polarity-type, 28% of compound, 12%
  of coverage errors; 1.7% false alarms on gold, still to be calibrated per LLM family. L2 accounting: ADD/DROP coverage,
  constants, predicate substitution; bag-of-words form 32% of coverage errors at 8.5% false alarms (paired AUROC 0.58); role-aware
  form not yet probed. L2 polarity/slot rules: NEG/REV/QUANT/SWAP; iteration-2 anchor 0.86-0.88 on synthetic REV/∀→∃, but
  polarity-type is only 10% of real repaired errors. L3 questionnaire: conditions vs assertions, claim grouping, force and
  order, aimed at COMPOUND and coverage; not yet probed, gated on ≥ 85% per-field accuracy. ARTIFACT PLAN (each executor has
  ≤ $10 of OpenRouter spend, tracked after every call; costs are estimated before each sweep). STEP 0, PRE-REGISTRATION: freeze
  the smell list, the L2 rules, the L3 schema, the thresholds, the splits, the strata and the analyses before any LLM-output
  label is seen. Go/no-go gate per component: ≤ 10% false alarms on verified-correct outputs in every length stratum, otherwise
  the component is dropped and the drop is reported. STEP 1, META-EVALUATION SET (dataset artifact, ≈ $8). (a) HUMAN TRACK:
  the curated FOLIO-validation conclusions and MALLS-test subset (302 items; 99 non-equivalent original→corrected pairs),
  plus a natural SPECIFICITY set: sentences shared between yfxiao/folio-refined and the DSAVlab-corrected FOLIO, i.e. two
  independent 'correct' annotations, whose non-equivalent pairs must classify as VOCAB/GRAN/CONVENTION or as a residual gold
  error confirmed by the panel. (b) LLM TRACK: about 1,500 sentences stratified by complexity (FOLIO-refined sentences, MALLS-test,
  and a stratified 600 from MALLS-train, oversampling those with at least 20 words, 3 or more conditions or exception markers).
  Candidates come from at least 8 distinct model families on OpenRouter, from small to frontier, each zero- and few-shot,
  plus ccg2lambda (kenken6696/folio_by_ccg2lambda) and the Logic-LM released FOLIO outputs. (c) SEMI-SYNTHETIC COMPOSED items:
  2-4 verified short gold rules nested under 'unless / provided that / except where' templates, with gold derived under both
  weak and strong exception readings. They form a separate stratum and are never pooled with real-error AUROC. (d) TYPED PERTURBATIONS
  of verified gold with the same 12 operators as the census, at matched DOWN/UP positions. (e) MEANING-PRESERVING REWRITES:
  STRICT (renaming, reordering, De Morgan, prenex, contrapositive) and CONVENTION (⊕/∨, weak/strong exception, →/↔ for 'means',
  added sortal restrictor, lexical negation). STEP 2, LABELS AND THEIR BIAS: z3 equivalence to corrected gold → equivalence
  modulo vocabulary (aligner, merge/split and arity-reification bridges) → minimal typed repair (depth ≤ 2, fingerprint-prefiltered,
  z3-verified; code in probes/repair_census.py) → panel adjudication of VOCAB/GRAN/COMPOUND plus a 20% sample. Report precision
  and recall of the automatic vocabulary classifier against the panel, the gold-error rate (including residual errors in corrected
  gold, L1-assisted), the correct-but-not-equivalent rate, the reading-choice rate, and every AUROC under naive, vocabulary-corrected
  and adjudicated labels. STEP 3, CENSUS (C2): minimal-typed-repair classes for human and LLM errors, per family and per complexity
  stratum, with bootstrap CIs. Include a χ² test against the uniform mix of standard perturbation suites and against each
  other. Specificity control: the same classifier on panel-confirmed correct-but-non-equivalent pairs; report error-vs-correct
  contrasts, not raw shares. STEP 4, REUSABLE FUNCTIONS (experiment artifact), each with a precise docstring: fol_lint(fol)
  → smell codes; content_accounting(text, fol); role_accounting(text, fol) (UD roles with generic-subject repair, DOWN-anchor
  polarity, slot order); formula_role_profile(fol) (solver-exact schema answers); role_questionnaire(text) (small LLM, text
  only; cost of about $0.0003 per item); fol_triage(text, fol) → {p_error, fired_layer, codes, coverage_status}; equivalent_modulo_vocab(a,
  b) and minimal_typed_repair(cand, ref), which are the labelling tools released with the dataset. STEP 5, BASELINES: parse
  rate; the pilot's structural metrics (joint-load conflicts, arity consistency, undefined predicates, rerun Jaccard); round-trip
  (a cheap LLM verbalises, then NLI and embedding similarity to the source, plus re-formalise-and-z3-equivalence); a cheap
  LLM judge on all items and a strong judge on a 300-item stratified subsample; K=5 sampling self-consistency modulo vocabulary;
  and a DECOMPOSED judge that sees the formula and is asked the L3 questions, which isolates what solver-exact answering adds.
  STEP 6, ANALYSES (evaluation artifact). Item level: AUROC, AUPRC and precision at the pre-registered threshold. Incremental
  value: nested logistic models with bootstrap ΔAUROC over the best baseline combination, plus partial correlations. System
  level: Kendall τ over families (prompt variants averaged) with a CI, reported descriptively, and over all variants. Per-error-type
  sensitivity by census class. Invariance: false alarms per rewrite family. Coverage, with every failure in the denominator.
  Cost in $ and seconds per item. Complexity: AUROC and false alarms against length, quantifier count, nesting depth, number
  of conditions and number of exceptions. A competing-effects test asks whether the cascade's slope is less negative than
  the judge's. Contamination: judge and round-trip accuracy on original vs disguised items. C3 decomposition: for each non-degenerate
  metric, MIX, WITHIN-TYPE and NOISE terms with paired bootstrap CIs; no τ-across-metrics test. Power: with about 300 errors
  and 300 correct outputs per pooled comparison, the AUROC SE is about 0.02 and the minimum detectable paired ΔAUROC is about
  0.05. Per stratum (≥ 50/50), the MDE is about 0.10; strata below that are declared untestable in advance.
success_criteria: >-
  C1 CONFIRM: (a) L1 precision ≥ 0.8 on real LLM errors, with false alarms ≤ 3% on verified-correct outputs of every model
  family for sentences under 20 words, and a reported, length-conditional false-alarm rate at 20 words or more. (b) The fused
  cascade's ΔAUROC over the best baseline combination has a 95% CI > 0 on adjudicated labels. (c) The cascade reaches AUROC
  ≥ 0.9 × the strong judge's at ≤ 5% of its cost, or beats it in the top complexity stratum. C1 PARTIAL: L1+L2 alone give
  a pre-filter with precision ≥ 0.8 that covers ≥ 25% of real LLM errors (the pilot on human errors shows 27% for L1 at 1.7%
  false alarms), but no ΔAUROC over the judge. This ships as a free first pass, with the remaining error mass stated. C1 DISCONFIRM:
  L1 precision < 0.6 on LLM outputs (the smells do not transfer from annotators to LLMs), AND the ΔAUROC CI includes 0 in
  every stratum. This is reported as a clear negative for structure-only gold-free checks, and the per-layer oracle-vs-deployable
  gap shows whether the checks or the text instruments failed. C2 CONFIRM: on LLM outputs, polarity-type operators ≤ 20% of
  repaired errors (CI upper bound < 0.25), coverage operators ≥ 40%, and the mix differs from uniform (χ² p < 0.01). The classifier
  labels ≥ 80% of panel-confirmed correct-but-non-equivalent pairs as non-errors (specificity control). Human-vs-LLM mix differences
  are reported either way. C2 DISCONFIRM: polarity-type ≥ 35% on LLM outputs, meaning LLMs err differently from annotators.
  This reverses the design priority back toward polarity anchors, and is reported as such. C3 CONFIRM (MIX-dominant): for
  ≥ 2/3 of non-degenerate non-LLM metrics, census-reweighted synthetic sensitivity is within ±0.10 of real sensitivity on
  clean labels. The result, 'typed perturbations are a valid proxy once reweighted by a real-error census', is actionable.
  C3 ALTERNATIVE: the reweighted prediction misses by more than 0.10. Per-operator WITHIN-TYPE ratios are then reported as
  the finding, e.g. that real DROPs remove the least salient condition. In every outcome the label-noise term is reported
  separately, so no gap is attributed to metrics that noise alone explains.

  conventions, and we repaired that; polarity now serves as one L2 rule.
inspiration: >-
  Three imports, each chosen because it directly fixes a measured failure. (1) SOFTWARE STATIC ANALYSIS: linters flag code
  that is almost never intended, without knowing the spec. Bug patterns are mined from real fixes (FindBugs, Getafix, wild-caught
  mutants). Applied to logic, some formulas are almost never what English means, so they can be flagged without reading the
  text. The pilot: 27% of real errors, 1.7% false alarms. (2) CLINICAL SCREENING CASCADES: a cheap, high-specificity test
  runs first, and costlier tests run only where the cheap one is blind, each with its false-positive rate fixed on known negatives.
  That fixes the compounding false alarms of iteration 1 and spends LLM money only on the error mass L1/L2 cannot see. (3)
  SUMMARIZATION FACTUALITY and MUTATION-TESTING methodology: census real errors first, then weight synthetic tests by that
  census (FRANK; Just et al.). In FOL this becomes testable exactly, because the minimal repair between a candidate and a
  reference can be SEARCHED and PROVED with a solver instead of annotated by hand.
terms:
- term: FOL-Triage
  definition: >-
    The proposed gold-free metric: L1 formula lint (no text), L2 text accounting (no LLM), L3 text-only role questionnaire
    (small LLM) compared with solver-exact formula answers. The three are fused into P(unfaithful), with the firing layer
    and an error code.
- term: Formula smell (lint rule)
  definition: >-
    A deterministic formula-only pattern that almost no English sentence means, e.g. ∃x(A→B), ∀x(A∧B), a restrictor inside
    ↔, glued independent claims, a free variable, an arity clash, a vacuous predicate, or a valid/unsatisfiable formula.
- term: Minimal typed repair
  definition: >-
    The smallest set of typed edits (NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE) that makes
    a candidate provably equivalent (z3) to the corrected gold after vocabulary alignment. More than 2 edits, or no repair
    found, is COMPOUND. It defines the error type of a real error.
- term: Vocabulary alignment
  definition: >-
    Renaming candidate predicates and constants onto reference ones (same arity, token/character similarity), plus merge/split
    and arity-reification bridges. Equivalence after alignment means VOCAB/GRAN, i.e. not an error. It is an upper bound,
    because meaning-changing renames also align, so it is adjudicated.
- term: Reading choice
  definition: >-
    A correction on a sentence the curators flagged ambiguous, where the gold picks one legitimate reading. It is a separate
    label class, not an error.
- term: Transfer decomposition (MIX / WITHIN-TYPE / NOISE)
  definition: >-
    A metric's synthetic-minus-real sensitivity is split into three parts. MIX: per-type synthetic sensitivity reweighted
    by the real census. WITHIN-TYPE: the same operator, synthetic vs real. NOISE: naive vs adjudicated labels.
- term: Solver-exact answerer
  definition: >-
    z3 queries that read role facts off a formula exactly: per-predicate monotonicity (DOWN = condition, UP = asserted), quantifier
    force per claim block, connectivity components (independent claims) and argument slots.

  definition: >-
    A faithful candidate that is not logically equivalent to gold because of vocabulary, granularity or a legitimate convention.
    It is estimated by alignment plus panel adjudication.
summary: >-
  FOL-Triage is a three-layer gold-free faithfulness check for NL→FOL: a text-free formula lint, LLM-free text accounting
  and a text-only small-LLM role questionnaire answered exactly by a solver on the formula side. In-step, the lint alone flagged
  27% of real annotator errors at 1.7% false alarms, and found an error in curated gold. The hypothesis also covers a minimal-typed-repair
  census of real errors (coverage dominates; polarity is about 10%; 46% compound) and a MIX/WITHIN-TYPE/NOISE decomposition
  of why synthetic perturbation tests overstate metric quality.
alternates:
- title: Text judges truth in solver-built worlds
  hypothesis: >-
    z3 builds small models that separate the candidate from its own typed single-edit mutants (the census operators). Each
    model is verbalised by template, and a small NLI model judges whether that situation is consistent with the text. The
    mismatch rate predicts real errors, including COMPOUND ones, with no gold and no large LLM.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    46% of real errors are compound restructurings that no role field isolates. A truth-value judgement on concrete situations
    sees any behavioural difference through one mechanism. It beats FOL-Triage if the small NLI model judges templated worlds
    with at least about 85% accuracy on long conditioned sentences.
- title: Agreement across systems by repair distance
  hypothesis: >-
    For each sentence, several diverse systems' outputs are aligned modulo vocabulary. A candidate's minimal-typed-repair
    distance to the cross-system medoid (0 = equivalent, 1-2 = typed edit, 3+ = compound) is its error score, and the repair
    operators give the error type.

    It needs no text-side instrument at all, which removes the weakest link (L2 bag-of-words AUROC was 0.59). It wins if errors
    are idiosyncratic across model families. It loses where families share a blind spot or a reading choice, which the census
    measures.
- title: Template verbalisation plus bidirectional entailment
  hypothesis: >-
    A deterministic, non-repairing FOL→English template verbaliser, plus a small NLI model checking entailment in both directions
    against the source, predicts faithfulness. Missing content fails text→formula entailment, and added content fails formula→text
    entailment.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    Coverage operators are 57% of repairable real errors, and bag-of-words accounting is weak on them. If NLI handles templated
    logical English, it captures coverage in context, which bag-of-words matching cannot, without any alignment step.
- title: A disguised cheap judge is enough
  hypothesis: >-
    A cheap LLM judge, shown the sentence and the formula with every predicate and constant renamed to neutral tokens (so
    memorised gold cannot help), matches the strong judge. Neither the lint nor the questionnaire adds signal over it.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If current small LLMs already recognise ∃x(A→B)-style shapes and dropped conditions, structure adds nothing and the cheapest
    reliable metric is the judge. C1(b)'s ΔAUROC test decides between them directly.
_relation_rationale: >-
  FOL-Triage becomes one half of a peer+text fusion; consensus lead is the other half, tested label-robustly
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Verdict corrected (reviewer MUST-FIX): no candidate passed the pre-registered rule. On 389 common label-consistent items,
  c_score vs judge is +0.057 [-0.022, 0.137] and fused vs judge is -0.020 [-0.111, 0.074]. The disguised cheap judge (0.777)
  is the incumbent.
- >-
  The ranking is label-dependent (MUST-FIX). On adjudicated screen labels (tier A+B, n=304), fused is 0.872 vs judge 0.771
  and c_score 0.776. The solver-to-panel transitions are 58 CORRECT->ERROR vs 1 the other way. So 'VOCAB = CORRECT' is flagged
  as the biggest label risk, replacing the claim that ADD+DROP errors are 'likely CORRECT'.
- >-
  Move = DEEPEN on the two leads (FOL-Triage text layers; cross-family consensus), merged into one complementary PEER+TEXT
  fusion. The mechanism is explicit: peers see family-specific structure errors (polarity blind spot 5%), and text sees shared
  errors and renames (38% of errors are peer-endorsed).
- >-
  New pre-registered mechanism tests P1-P4: per-type crossover at matched FA, disjointness of the two signals among errors,
  the length slope (exact consensus -0.94/SD words vs graded consensus vs judge), and rewrite invariance on ONE shared rewrite
  set.
- >-
  Fix F1: name-free structural alignment (arity, monotonicity, block, argument graph, optional text anchor), verified by entailment.
  It targets c_score's RENAME 96% false alarms and removes the shared-align() confound with the labeller.
- >-
  Fix F2: graded clause-level consensus (support/coverage entailment F1 against peers). It targets the saturation of exact
  equivalence on long sentences and yields ADD/DROP/NEG/QUANT codes with location, which is the user's error-type ask.
- >-
  Fix F3: fusion weights fitted only on screen items where the solver and adjudicated labels agree; threshold set on LLM-system
  CORRECT items (the iteration-1 FA was 0.19 vs 0.10). Frozen before E labels are read.
- >-
  Label robustness is now part of the claim. Regimes: R_AB (panel), R_A (tier A), R_ADJ (a new reference-aware frontier adjudicator
  from a family that is neither generator nor judge, gated at balanced acc ≥0.85 on the 96 expert pairs + 77 gate items),
  and R_COMP (a composed-long stratum with references trusted by construction, because L25 tier A is untestable).
- >-
  Dataset E is used as CONFIRMATION only (frozen weights, scored once). The screen (track L/H) is used for all fitting. There
  is no subgroup hunting if confirmation fails.
- >-
  Every requested baseline is re-run on E with the same ids, including S4 = all cheap baselines + judge (nested ΔAUROC). The
  frontier judge is included, because iteration 1 showed +0.077 [0.006, 0.154] on original text that vanished under disguise,
  at a cost above the gate.
- >-
  Candidate B (B1/B2) was planned but never executed (exp 2 is empty). B2 (solver worlds judged by a text-only reader) gets
  one capped ($2) execution as a standalone metric and a fusion feature; it is dropped if it breaks again.
- >-
  Closed with no further budget: L1 lint on LLM outputs (0.508, but kept as a free gold-audit tool), L2-role (0.557), the
  user's pilot structural metrics (0.50-0.53, a negative result), and round-trip re-formalisation (0.513).
- >-
  Reframed as confirming prior work, not novel: consensus beating self-consistency (+0.140) confirms SAC3. The new contribution
  is the solver-graded, name-free clause consensus with typed localisation, and its complementarity with solver-exact text
  checks under label-robust validation.
- >-
  Descriptive by-products with no separate budget: the census (formerly C2) and the synthetic-to-real decomposition (formerly
  C3). The typed-perturbation suite is kept for the user's per-type sensitivity requirement.

title: Do other models' translations agree? Consensus metric for NL-to-logic
summary: >-
  Experiment 3 screens candidate C, a text-free, gold-free consensus metric for NL->FOL faithfulness, on the shared frozen
  screen (label hash 0e43cbdd...). c_score = 1 - eq_frac: the share of OTHER systems' translations of the same sentence that
  are NOT z3-equivalent to the candidate modulo vocabulary alignment. The pool has 6 fresh OpenRouter families (llama-3.3-70b,
  qwen3-235b, deepseek-v3.1, mistral-small-3.2, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gpt-4.1-mini) plus the 3 released Logic-LM systems,
  leave-one-out. Also scored: medoid repair depth and operators, and semantic entropy over z3 classes. Baselines: K=5 self-consistency
  (gpt-4.1-nano T=0.7 on all items; true same-model gpt-3.5-turbo SC for gpt-3.5 candidates), predicate-set stability, and
  FOL length. PRIMARY (track L, 297 CORRECT vs 249 ERROR, sentence-clustered bootstrap 2000): c_score AUROC 0.866 [0.821,
  0.906]; peers-only 0.872; non-OpenAI peers 0.863; other Logic-LM systems only 0.753; cluster entropy 0.773; medoid depth
  0.722; sc5_cheap 0.725 [0.669, 0.781] (n=546, now complete). Paired Δ c_score - sc5_cheap = +0.140 [0.085, 0.197]; c_score
  - sc5_same = +0.140 [0.057, 0.227] (n=167). Cross-fitted [c_score, sc5] vs [sc5] = +0.147. Vocab-clean subset (shared-aligner
  confound control): c_score 0.852 vs SC 0.714. At the medoid threshold: recall 0.62, false alarms 0.14. Shared blind spot:
  38% of errors are endorsed by the consensus (POLARITY 5%, COVERAGE 41%, STRUCT 57%). Repair operators match the labeller's
  81% of the time (chance 46%). RENAME rewrites cause 96% false alarms (the aligner does not survive synonym or constant renaming);
  z3-equivalent rewrites flip 0% by construction. Long/conditioned stratum n=5, descriptive only. Cost: $1.52 total; the peer
  pool costs $0.0015 per sentence. This re-run completed the SC_cheap arm that the shared-key limit had cut to 231/307 units,
  and restored WordNet for RENAME.

  Experiment D (baseline/null arm) on the SHARED FROZEN SCREEN: data/screen_items.json, 1,090 items. Track L = 796 Logic-LM
  FOLIO-dev outputs labelled vs corrected gold or agreed premises: 294 CORRECT / 230 ERROR / 216 UNCERTAIN / 56 UNPARSEABLE.
  Track H = 294 curated original-vs-corrected items. Label-vector sha1 122d01df... FINAL judges are the planned API models,
  under prereg.json: judge_cheap = gemini-2.5-flash-lite (JSON 0-100, rubric A), judge_cheap2 = gpt-4.1-nano (P(YES)), judge_strong
  = gemini-3.1-pro-preview (frontier; 200L+96H subset). Open-weight local judges (Qwen3-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-14B-nf4; run
  during a key outage) are kept as judge_local_* rows. API spend $2.02. Track L AUROC [95% CI]: judge_cheap_disg 0.777 [0.720,
  0.827] = THE BAR; judge_cheap_orig 0.749; gpt-4.1-nano 0.750/0.714; frontier orig 0.802 on the subset, which is +0.077 [0.006,
  0.154] over the cheap judge on the same items (DeLong p=.015), with the gap vanishing under disguise; rt_nli_min 0.710 (API
  verbaliser) / 0.740 (local verbaliser); rt_embed_cos 0.633; rt_reformalise_eq 0.513 (near chance). User's pilot structural
  metrics are 0.50-0.53 (a negative result); cross-system rerun Jaccard 0.720. The cross-fitted S4 combination of all cheap
  baselines has OOF AUROC 0.817 [0.762, 0.867], which is +0.039 [-0.010, 0.087] over the judge (not significant). best_baseline_oof
  per item and data/folds.json are provided for nested deltas in iteration 2. Contamination: no evidence. Every DiD CI includes
  0; the frontier judge loses ~0.07 under disguise on both tracks (lost lexical meaning); the recall probe matches the corrected
  gold 15.9% vs the erroneous original 4.4%. Invariance: the judges false-alarm on contrapositive (cheap 0.67, nano 0.97),
  De Morgan and rename rewrites. Judge correctness falls with sentence length (p=1.6e-5); long sentences are untestable on
  track L. Label noise: 56% of L ERRORs are subst_only; results/judge_label_disagreements.csv is there for dataset-E adjudication.
  All headline numbers were re-derived independently, with placebos, in results/audit_headlines.json. Outputs: method_out.json

title: Held-out logic translation test set, panel-checked
summary: >-
  Held-out NL->FOL faithfulness meta-evaluation set (run_u75jRHUss0zo, iter 1, dataset E). full_data_out.json (exp_sel_data_out,
  27.7 MB) has 4 groups. (1) heldout_candidates: 8,507 rows = real FOL candidates for 700 screen-disjoint sentences. Strata:
  MALLS-train L25=300 (>=25 words, >=3 conditions; includes a pre-registered 100-sentence top-up), L20=150, EXC=100 (unless/except/without),
  and FOLIO-train CTRL=150. Generators: 10 LLM slots over 9 families, few-shot at temperature 0; zero-shot Llama-70B/Qwen3;
  GPT-5.1 on 200 sentences; ccg2lambda; the MALLS GPT-4 gold as a system. input=JSON{text,candidate_fol,reference_fol,system,prompt_variant};
  output=CORRECT/ERROR/CONTESTED/UNRESOLVED/UNPARSEABLE. Labels combine the shared z3 solver labeller with a blind, nonce-disguised,
  family-disjoint panel (Haiku-4.5/GLM-4.6/Kimi-K2; Haiku adjudicates only GLM/Kimi disagreements). The combination rule gives
  tier A (solver), B (panel-decided VOCAB_GRAN/COMPOUND) and C (no trusted reference). Metadata per row: sentence_id (bootstrap
  cluster), item_id, strata {words,n_quant,depth,n_conditions,exception_type,source_stratum,l25_topup_batch}, auto_label,
  repair_ops, panel_votes, error_ops, label_tier, reference_status, correct_not_equivalent, reading_choice, disguised_text/fol.
  Tier A+B testable: L25 176 CORRECT/697 ERROR; L20, EXC and CTRL are also testable. (2) heldout_sentences: 700 rows with
  reference status (GOLD_PANEL_OK 95, PANEL_REPAIRED 145, NO_TRUSTED_REFERENCE 295, TRUSTED_AGREED 36, DISPUTED 112). (3)
  panel_calibration: 77 synthetic gate items plus 96 expert track-H real-error pairs with panel votes. (4) screen_audit: 1,173
  Logic-LM track-L and curated track-H rows keyed by the screen's item_id; also in screen_adjudicated_labels.json. Caveats:
  the panel is STRICT. Its majority accuracy on real errors is 0.727, and it accepts only 0.61 of expert-corrected formulas.
  It rejected 82% of MALLS gold, so ERROR is over-called: confirm on tier A too. HELD-OUT: iteration 2 must not tune thresholds
  on it. Primary analysis = tiers A+B excluding CONTESTED and reading_choice, bootstrapped by sentence_id. See dataset_card.md.

  Held-out confirmation of PEER+TEXT (NL->FOL faithfulness without gold) on dataset E (8,507 candidate rows, 700 sentences),
  frozen on the iteration-1 screen (prereg sha256 b9f28b1b, git a6896ce) and scored once. PEER = graded cross-family consensus
  (claim units, peer aligned into candidate vocabulary, finite-model refuter + z3 entailment; support/coverage/g_score, unit
  error codes); TEXT = iteration-1 L2-bow + L3 (text-only questionnaire vs z3 role profile); fused by a screen-fitted logistic.
  RESULTS (R_AB tiers A+B, 1822 ERR/864 COR): PEER+TEXT AUROC .790 [.75,.82] (stratified .753; long pool .768; tier-A L20+EXC

  judge bar is UNTESTABLE (shared OpenRouter key hit $0 at 18:00 UTC; the replacement key was also exhausted, polled 19:10-22:13
  UTC; 20 rows); the local judge is a labelled secondary bar. Fusion does NOT beat c_score_align alone (stratified +.011 n.s.;
  tier A c_score_align .860 > .818), and that aligner is shared with the solver labeller (confound open). Name-free alignment
  'failed' the screen gate only through a threshold-tie artefact; post hoc NF-anchored passes (RENAME FA .074, ROLE_PERMUTE
  recall .77) and its fusion gives .759 on E. P1 INCONCLUSIVE (PEER>TEXT on ADD/DROP errors, TEXT>PEER on peer-endorsed),

title: Long logic sentences and FOL error suite
summary: >-
  Two held-out NL->FOL faithfulness tables (full_data_out.json, aii exp_sel_data_out, every row re-verified against its sources
  by data.py and z3-re-verified by src/verify.py, 0 failures). (1) PERTURB (group perturb_suite, COMPLETE): 4,234 typed mutants
  (metadata_fold PERTURB, output ERROR, error_ops=[op]) plus 868 meaning-preserving controls (PERTURB_CONTROL, output CORRECT).
  They cover 300 bases: 36 TRUSTED_AGREED + 95 GOLD_PANEL_OK + 69 PANEL_REPAIRED dataset-E references, and 100 R_COMP weak
  readings. Operators are NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD (ADD_FOREIGN / ADD_INTERNAL), SWAP, BIND and MEANING_RENAME,
  at DOWN/UP positions (metadata_position_polarity, polarity_method, matched_pair_id; 1,354 complete pairs). QUANT/REV/RESTR
  are UP-only; SCOPE and UNGLUE have 0 rows. Each mutant is z3 non-equivalent to every accepted reading. Controls are RENAME_SYN
  / RENAME_NONCE, REORDER and CONTRAPOSITIVE/DEMORGAN, each z3-equivalent. (2) R_COMP (group rcomp_sentences): 250 main +
  100 reserve templated sentences, each with >=25 words, >=3 conditions and one unless/except/provided-that/only-if clause
  (9 templates). Weak and strong references come from the template (T8 also stores a not-accepted converse), are unit-tested
  and z3-checked, and are built from a 652-entry atom lexicon mined from verified FOLIO/MALLS references. Provenance fields:
  template_id, lexicon_ids, source_rule_ids. CAVEAT: the shared OpenRouter key hit its daily limit 5 minutes in ($0.41 spent);
  the 21:38 UTC replacement key was also already exhausted. Pending: the Sonnet lexicon and reference audits, fluency, generator
  candidates (rcomp_candidates), solver labels, adjudication and the testability declaration. ./run_all.sh completes them
  resumably under the pre-registered prereg_rcomp.json. Until then R_COMP must not be used for metric claims. PERTURB is ready
  for per-operator sensitivity and invariance analysis. Rows carry item_id (E's recipe) and disguised_text/fol. adjudicator_check_out.json
  holds 60 known-label QA items. See dataset_card.md.

  vs bow_uncarried (0.711). Panel expert-pair acceptance is .613 (unambiguous). Independent re-derivation (different code
  path) matches all headline numbers. On permuted labels the cross-fitted PT is biased below 0.5; the observed deltas exceed
  all 20 null deltas (null max .047 solver / .087 A+B).

NEW THIS ITERATION: These 3 artifacts were created to address the reviewer
feedback. Their findings should be the primary basis for your revisions.

id: art_TaxJRnPcJMuZ
type: experiment
summary: >-
  Held-out confirmation of PEER+TEXT (NL->FOL faithfulness without gold) on dataset E (8,507 candidate rows, 700 sentences),
  frozen on the iteration-1 screen (prereg sha256 b9f28b1b, git a6896ce) and scored once. PEER = graded cross-family consensus
  (claim units, peer aligned into candidate vocabulary, finite-model refuter + z3 entailment; support/coverage/g_score, unit
  error codes); TEXT = iteration-1 L2-bow + L3 (text-only questionnaire vs z3 role profile); fused by a screen-fitted logistic.
  RESULTS (R_AB tiers A+B, 1822 ERR/864 COR): PEER+TEXT AUROC .790 [.75,.82] (stratified .753; long pool .768; tier-A L20+EXC
  .818) vs iteration-1 c_score_align .782, NF-anchored c_score .743, TEXT .693, local Qwen3-8B disguised judge .712. Delta
  vs local judge +.078 [.043,.112] pooled, +.115 long pool, +.075 stratified; CTRL -.031 n.s. The pre-registered flash-lite
  judge bar is UNTESTABLE (shared OpenRouter key hit $0 at 18:00 UTC; the replacement key was also exhausted, polled 19:10-22:13
  UTC; 20 rows); the local judge is a labelled secondary bar. Fusion does NOT beat c_score_align alone (stratified +.011 n.s.;
  tier A c_score_align .860 > .818), and that aligner is shared with the solver labeller (confound open). Name-free alignment
  'failed' the screen gate only through a threshold-tie artefact; post hoc NF-anchored passes (RENAME FA .074, ROLE_PERMUTE
  recall .77) and its fusion gives .759 on E. P1 INCONCLUSIVE (PEER>TEXT on ADD/DROP errors, TEXT>PEER on peer-endorsed),
  P2 REFUTED, P3 INCONCLUSIVE (gap vs judge grows with length, diff-in-delta +.146 CI>0), P4 REFUTED (fused RENAME FA .385).
  Unit-code typing at chance (.37 vs .38). Disguise improves the judge (no contamination benefit). Within-stratum placebo
  .59 (composition), global .50. FILES: results/per_item_E.jsonl (row_key=item_id|prompt_variant, fold_E=sha1('E_folds_v1|'+sid)%5,
  every score) for the iteration-3 join; results/analysis.json, tables.md, p_tests.json, deviations.json, prereg.json; src/peer_text.py
  reusable functions; method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out, predict_* for all metrics). Audits: tests/audit_rederive.py re-derives
  pooled AUROCs and headline delta to 1e-9; tests/placebo_headline.py (shuffled labels fail); prefilter audit 0 conflicts;
  judge prompt identity 30/30. OpenRouter spend $0.155.
title: Peer agreement plus text checks, held-out test

id: art_zcwCQgTqk6DN
type: dataset
summary: >-
  Two held-out NL->FOL faithfulness tables (full_data_out.json, aii exp_sel_data_out, every row re-verified against its sources
  by data.py and z3-re-verified by src/verify.py, 0 failures). (1) PERTURB (group perturb_suite, COMPLETE): 4,234 typed mutants
  (metadata_fold PERTURB, output ERROR, error_ops=[op]) plus 868 meaning-preserving controls (PERTURB_CONTROL, output CORRECT).
  They cover 300 bases: 36 TRUSTED_AGREED + 95 GOLD_PANEL_OK + 69 PANEL_REPAIRED dataset-E references, and 100 R_COMP weak
  readings. Operators are NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD (ADD_FOREIGN / ADD_INTERNAL), SWAP, BIND and MEANING_RENAME,
  at DOWN/UP positions (metadata_position_polarity, polarity_method, matched_pair_id; 1,354 complete pairs). QUANT/REV/RESTR
  are UP-only; SCOPE and UNGLUE have 0 rows. Each mutant is z3 non-equivalent to every accepted reading. Controls are RENAME_SYN
  / RENAME_NONCE, REORDER and CONTRAPOSITIVE/DEMORGAN, each z3-equivalent. (2) R_COMP (group rcomp_sentences): 250 main +
  100 reserve templated sentences, each with >=25 words, >=3 conditions and one unless/except/provided-that/only-if clause
  (9 templates). Weak and strong references come from the template (T8 also stores a not-accepted converse), are unit-tested
  and z3-checked, and are built from a 652-entry atom lexicon mined from verified FOLIO/MALLS references. Provenance fields:
  template_id, lexicon_ids, source_rule_ids. CAVEAT: the shared OpenRouter key hit its daily limit 5 minutes in ($0.41 spent);
  the 21:38 UTC replacement key was also already exhausted. Pending: the Sonnet lexicon and reference audits, fluency, generator
  candidates (rcomp_candidates), solver labels, adjudication and the testability declaration. ./run_all.sh completes them
  resumably under the pre-registered prereg_rcomp.json. Until then R_COMP must not be used for metric claims. PERTURB is ready
  for per-operator sensitivity and invariance analysis. Rows carry item_id (E's recipe) and disguised_text/fol. adjudicator_check_out.json
  holds 60 known-label QA items. See dataset_card.md.

title: Re-checking earlier logic-metric results across label sets
</new_artifacts_this_iteration>

<data_files>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<task>
Write the run's internal research report as markdown, with figure placeholders and, where a
claim cites outside work, a BibTeX-backed reference. <report_rules> above says what the document
is; this says what to do to it now.

YOUR TURN (gen_report_text): APPEND this iteration's section.

You are the researcher keeping the lab notebook. The text in <previous_report> is what the run
has recorded so far. Your job is to add to it, not to rewrite it.

1. CARRY THE REPORT FORWARD VERBATIM. Reproduce <previous_report> in full, unchanged, as the
   start of your output. The only edits allowed to an earlier section are factual corrections —
   a number that has since been shown wrong, a claim an artifact has since disproved — and each
   one is marked in place as a correction, with what changed and why.
2. WRITE THIS ITERATION'S SECTION and put it at the END. Four things, in this order:
   (a) WHY THIS ITERATION RAN WHAT IT RAN — the strategy, and what in <reviewer_feedback> or the
       hypothesis update prompted it.
   (b) WHAT HAPPENED — every artifact in <new_artifacts_this_iteration>: what it did, and its
       results IN FULL. Read the output files in each artifact's workspace and typeset every
       table you find. This is the only place those numbers are ever written down.
   (c) WHAT WAS LEARNED — what the evidence now supports, what it rules out, and any direction
       this iteration killed, labelled as a dead end with the evidence that killed it.
   (d) WHAT THE NEXT ITERATION TAKES FROM IT — the open question this iteration hands forward.
3. KEEP THE CLOSING SECTION CURRENT. The report ends with a "What we have learned so far"
   section covering the whole run; rewrite that one each iteration so it reflects the evidence
   as it now stands.
4. ADDRESS THE REVIEW WHERE IT WAS RIGHT. <reviewer_feedback> reviews the report for
   completeness and traceability, not for salesmanship. A critique that says a result is
   missing, unsupported, or untraceable to its artifact is fixed at the place it points to.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
THE REPORT'S FIGURES ARE CHARTS OF THIS RUN'S OWN NUMBERS. Nothing else. Every figure here is
rendered deterministically by the aii-data-fig-gen skill from the values you supply, so each bar
is exactly the height of its number and a reader can check the figure against the table beside
it. There is no image model in this document and no `figure_type` to choose: the schema takes
data figures only. Conceptual artwork, architecture drawings and flow diagrams belong to the
publishable paper, which is written later and separately.

WHAT BECOMES A FIGURE, AND WHAT DOES NOT:
  - A chart, when the point is a SHAPE the eye reads faster than the digits: a trend over a
    sweep, a gap between conditions, a distribution, a trade-off front, a confusion matrix, an
    ablation delta.
  - A MARKDOWN TABLE, when the point is the values themselves. Tabular data stays a table. A
    four-row result table redrawn as a chart loses the exact numbers and gains nothing.
  - Nothing at all, when neither: not every iteration earns a figure, and an empty one costs the
    reader a page turn.

FIGURE FORMAT: put a [FIGURE:fig_id] marker in the report text where the chart belongs — inside the
iteration section that produced its numbers, next to the table or the paragraph it settles — and
give the full spec in the separate `figures` structured-output array. Every id in the array
matches a marker in the text, and every marker matches an id.

Set `aspect_ratio` per figure: 16:9 for side-by-side comparisons and multi-panel results, 4:3
for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps / confusion matrices / scatter plots, 21:9 for a long timeline
or a wide many-category bar chart.

Example in the report text:
  "...tail latency fell by more than half while throughput dropped to a quarter.

[FIGURE:fig3]

The sweep in Table 2 shows..."

Example in the figures array:
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Latency across the three optimizers", "caption": "Geometric mean query latency, with standard error over 40 queries. The learned optimizer is 2.3x faster than PostgreSQL's planner.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

CRITICAL: before writing a figure spec, open the artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and read the exact values out of them. The renderer cannot read files — every number, series
name, axis label and unit MUST be in `image_gen_detailed_description`, unrounded and exactly as
the run produced it. A figure whose numbers disagree with the table above it is a defect in the
record.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib, aii-web-tools.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. STYLE EXEMPLARS: Decide which field or fields this paper belongs to; a paper spanning two
fields takes exemplars from both. If `./style_exemplars.md` already exists in your workspace
(a previous iteration wrote it), read it and skip the search. Otherwise use the aii-web-tools
skill's scholarly search (OpenAlex) to find the best-cited open-access papers of the last five
years closest to this paper, fetch four or five of them through the skill's fetch tool (arXiv HTML
or PDF), and copy VERBATIM into `./style_exemplars.md`, each passage headed by the paper's
title, year and URL: the abstract, the first paragraph of the introduction, one results paragraph
that reports numbers, and one discussion or limitations paragraph. Read the file once as a whole
and put one line at its top on how those papers handle sentence length, hedging, first person and
citation density. Their sentences and their content are never reused; they are exemplars of style,
not sources.

When you build the file, also record how those same papers are ORGANISED. At its end, under the
heading `## Section outlines`, give each paper its title and then its section headings in
order, worded as the paper words them, with the subsections of its method and results sections;
then one line on how its method is organised (by component, by pipeline stage, by theorem) and one
on how its results are organised (by research question, by dataset, main results then ablations).
Headings and those two lines only, no prose from the sections. The outlines are for the
publishable paper written at the end of the run, which checks its own section list against them;
they are not a structure for the report you are writing now.

Then, from those same papers — abstracts, method and results sections — plus every title in any
`references.bib` you have compiled, extract THE FIELD'S OWN VOCABULARY: the words it uses for its
concepts, its metrics and its experimental conditions. Write 50 to
150 of them to `./domain_terms.json` as a JSON array, each entry
{"term": "...", "gloss": "one clause saying what it means", "source_title": "the paper you took it
from"}. Terms only — no sentences, no section names, no author names. This file is what the final
paper is checked against: a name that is in it is the field's name and passes, a technical term
that is not is treated as an invented one and has to be defined or replaced. If the file already
exists, read it and add only what is missing.
TODO 4. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]."

ON AN APPEND: the markers are part of the report, not scaffolding. Every [ARTIFACT:id] marker
in <previous_report> is carried forward unchanged, and every claim in your new section that
rests on an artifact gets one. Re-typing an earlier section is the moment they get lost — a
text that comes back with no markers at all, while <all_artifacts> is non-empty, is an
incomplete report and goes back to you.
TODO 5. WRITE THE SECTION: Carry <previous_report> forward verbatim, then write this iteration's
section at the end, per <task> and <report_rules>. Put [FIGURE:fig_id] markers where a chart of this
run's numbers belongs, per <figure_instructions>, and give the specs in the figures array. Cite outside work
with numeric references [1], [2], and keep the bibliography section at the very end of the text,
after the iteration sections. Every table from every artifact this iteration ran goes in, in
full. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate image/figure files. Do NOT emit your structured output
when the section is written — TODO 6 is a separate pass over it first.

REQUIRED FILE: the report text lives in `./paper_draft.md` in your workspace. Write the full text
there as you go — carried-forward sections plus what you have of this iteration's — overwriting
it as it grows. This is a REQUIRED output file: the pipeline reads the report from this file and
from nowhere else, and it is also what survives if the run is interrupted, so keep it current
rather than treating it as a first draft you move on from.
TODO 6. APPEND PASS — start this ONLY once TODO 5's section is written, and treat it as a distinct
pass over the finished text. An append is a different job from a revision, and its failure modes
are the opposite ones, so check for these:

1. NOTHING EARLIER WAS REWRITTEN. Diff your text against <previous_report> in your head, section
   by section. Every earlier section reads exactly as it did, except where you marked a factual
   correction in place. A section silently reworded is the run's own history edited after the
   fact, and the reasoning it held is then gone for good.
2. NOTHING WAS SUMMARISED AWAY. Every table an artifact produced this iteration is present with
   its actual numbers. Go back to each artifact workspace and check the output files against
   what you wrote. "Improved over baseline" where a table exists is the defect.
3. THE DEAD ENDS ARE STILL THERE. Anything this iteration abandoned is written down as
   abandoned, with what killed it.
4. THE REASONING IS THERE, NOT JUST THE RESULT. For each artifact: why it was chosen, not only
   what it returned. A reader must be able to reconstruct the decision.
5. THE CLOSING SECTION IS CURRENT. "What we have learned so far" reflects this iteration too.
6. `summary` describes the run's finding as it now stands — never the revision. Write what the
   evidence supports today, with its headline number; a sentence about what changed since the
   last iteration is the wrong answer to this field.
7. IT READS. Take the section you just wrote start to finish as a researcher who was not on this
   run. Every table is introduced by a sentence that says what it settles; no paragraph is a
   list of decimals with connectives; nothing turns on a label only this run knows. Move the
   digits into the tables and captions and let the sentences carry the comparison. Then read one
   exemplar passage beside a paragraph of yours: the sentences should sound like theirs, per
   <writing_register>. This is the one item that is about the prose rather than the contents, and
   it is not optional: an unreadable complete record is a record nobody reads.

Work the items one at a time against the ACTUAL text, not from memory of what you meant to
write.
TODO 7. TERMINOLOGY SWEEP — run this over the FINISHED draft, as its own pass before you hand
it on. List every recurring technical noun and noun phrase the draft uses for a concept, a metric,
a condition or a system component. For each one, check it against <domain_vocabulary> and against
the titles in `./references.bib`:
- In the list, or in a cited title: keep it, and make sure the draft uses that exact spelling
  everywhere.
- Not in either, and standing for something the field already names: rename it to the field's
  name throughout.
- Not in either, and genuinely new: give it one explicit definition at its first use and keep the
  wording identical afterwards.
- A bare code in a sentence (C1, M3): replace it with the name of the thing.
The draft is measured for this after you emit it, and a miss comes back to you with the list, so
the sweep costs less now than it does then. `./domain_terms.json` holds the same list on
disk if you would rather read it there.

The report is the paper's only source, so a private label invented here is one the paper
inherits. Sweep the section you just wrote; earlier sections keep the words they already have,
except where a rename is the factual correction <task> allows and you mark it as one.

Then use 'ls' to verify `./paper_draft.md` exists and holds the whole report, and emit the
structured JSON — that is your ONLY output. It carries the title, abstract, figures and summary,
plus `out_expected_files` naming `paper_draft.md`; the report text itself stays in the file.
Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate image/figure files at any point.

### [3] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-24 00:29:36 UTC

```
I work on converting natural-language text into first-order logic (NL→FOL, autoformalization) with
LLM pipelines. Evaluation is the bottleneck. Correct FOL for a sentence is not unique — different
predicate names, different decompositions of the same concept, and logically equivalent rewrites can
all be correct. Gold FOL annotations are rare and expensive. The metrics in use either need a gold
formula (exact match, BLEU, prover-checked equivalence to the gold) or only check that the output
parses. In my own pilot I used cheap structural metrics: whether a set of generated formulas loads
together without conflicts, whether predicate arities stay consistent, how many predicates are used
but never defined, and how similar the predicate sets are across reruns. Those measure stability and
composability, not whether a formula says what the sentence says.

Find new metrics for NL→FOL output quality. Operating situation: you are given a natural-language
sentence (or short passage) and a candidate FOL formalization produced by any system. There is no gold
formula, no ontology or controlled vocabulary, and no domain knowledge. The metric returns a score
that predicts whether the formalization is faithful to the text, and ideally which kind of error it
contains (quantifier or scope error, dropped or added condition, negation/polarity error, swapped
arguments, conflated or wrongly split concepts). Metrics may score a single formula or a set (several
samples for one sentence, or the formalizations of all sentences in one document). They must be
task-agnostic — usable for any NL→FOL setting, not tied to a domain, dataset or pipeline — and cheap
enough to run on every output (solver calls and small models are fine; a large-LLM judge per formula
only if shown to earn its cost).

Requirements:
- Keep the target fixed: the metric must predict faithfulness to the text. Detecting synthetic
  perturbations, parse validity, or run-to-run stability are not substitutes for that target.
- Validate against ground truth, never against the metric itself. Use public datasets with gold
  sentence-level FOL (e.g. FOLIO, MALLS, or others you find) to build a meta-evaluation set: real
  candidate formalizations from several different systems, plus controlled perturbations of gold
  formulas with known error types, labelled via prover-checked equivalence to gold. Handle two known
  problems: some gold annotations are wrong, and a candidate can be correct without being equivalent
  to the gold (different vocabulary or granularity). Estimate how often each happens and how it
  biases the labels. These datasets are public, so check whether LLM-based metrics benefit from having
  seen the gold.
- For each metric report: correlation with correctness at item and system level; sensitivity per error
  type; invariance under meaning-preserving rewrites (variable/predicate renaming, reordering,
  equivalent restatements); coverage — unparseable outputs are counted and reported, never silently
  dropped; and cost.
- Compare against baselines: parse/compile rate, round-trip (FOL→NL→compare) similarity,
  LLM-as-judge, sampling self-consistency, and the structural consistency metrics described above. A
  new metric matters only if it adds signal those don't.
- Report how each metric's reliability changes with sentence complexity (length, number of quantifiers,
  nesting depth, number of conditions and exceptions). Long, heavily conditioned sentences matter most
  to me.
- Negative results are welcome: if a family of metrics does not track correctness, show that clearly.

Out of scope: comparing grounded vs ungrounded generation (ontology vocabulary injected into prompts),
anything that depends on a particular ontology, and building a better NL→FOL translator. The
contribution is the measurement, not the translator.

Deliverables: reusable Python functions taking (text, fol) — or a set of such pairs — each with a
precise statement of what it measures; the meta-evaluation dataset with its labels; and the results.

I appended a pilot study of this problem with some metrics I already used but haven't verified. Just for reference.

### [4] SKILL-INPUT — aii-paper-writing · 2026-09-24 00:30:45 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-paper-writing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-paper-writing
description: "Writes the PROSE of an AI research paper: abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, discussion and conclusion, with a page budget, the 5-paragraph intro pattern, writing-quality rules, inline [FIGURE:fig_id] markers plus a structured figures array, and a MANDATORY REVISION_CHECKLIST.md pass over every finished draft. Use whenever a paper, abstract, section, or full write-up is being drafted or rewritten for a venue such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR or ACL. Triggers: write a paper, paper structure, abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, contributions, figure caption and placement, revision pass, academic prose. NOT for: assembling or compiling .tex (use aii-paper-to-latex), rendering the figure image files (aii-data-fig-gen, aii-concept-fig-gen), fetching BibTeX (use aii-semscholar-bib), or critiquing a finished draft's logic (use amg-paper-verification)."
---

## MANDATORY: the final revision pass

**`REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`, in this skill's own directory, MUST be read and
applied to every finished draft, always, as a separate pass after the writing
is done.** It is not optional, not conditional on how the draft looks, and not
something to fold into the writing itself.

Writing and revising are different jobs and cannot be done in one pass. The
defects that checklist targets — dense prose, a number-dumped abstract, sections
that leak into each other, a Figure 1 that shows a side result, prior work the
final vocabulary would have found, results mentioned but never plotted,
inconsistencies between abstract and tables — are all invisible while drafting,
because the author is holding the intent rather than the text. Every one of them
is obvious to the first outside reader. Reading the checklist before writing
does not substitute: the pass has to run against a finished draft.

So the order is always: write the complete draft → read `REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`
→ work its items against the full text, fixing as you go → only then emit the
output.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Run the `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` script with the full list in one batch and
   `--out ./references.bib`: it writes `./references.bib` and the fetch record `./references.json`
3. Cite each paper by the key the script printed

Rules:
- References enter `./references.bib` ONLY through the fetch script — never write or edit BibTeX by hand
- If a paper still isn't found after the skill's fallback procedure, do not cite it
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

ALWAYS use whenever a bibliography, reference list or .bib file is being built or extended, and whenever a citation needs a verified entry instead of an invented one — never hand-write or edit BibTeX.

---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar (OpenAlex, then Crossref, when S2 is rate-limited or down). Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Fallback when S2 is down** → if S2 still answers 429 (its shared anonymous pool saturates for every caller) or 5xx after its bounded retries, or cannot be reached, S2 is skipped for the rest of the call, and for the next 10-15 min in every call (then one probe decides whether it is back); every ref it did not answer resolves through **OpenAlex**, then **Crossref** (both keyless; set `AII_POLITE_CONTACT` for their higher-limit polite pool). DOI/arXiv hits must agree with the ref's title or first author, so a mislinked record is dropped rather than cited; title hits need a near-exact title. The BibTeX has the same layout, keys and fields as S2's, so `references.bib` cannot tell them apart; each entry's `source` (`semantic_scholar`, `openalex` or `crossref`) says which API answered.
4. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY, accents folded), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": "", "source": "semantic_scholar"}],
  "failed": []
}
```

Called as a tool (or through `--json`), it returns these entries and writes no file. A bibliography
is built only through the CLI's `--out`, which also writes the record.

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Run the CLI below with the full list in **one call** and `--out ./references.bib`
3. The script merges the fetched entries into `references.bib` (created if absent) and writes a
   record of each one to `references.json` beside it: source database, S2 paperId / DOI / arXiv id,
   title, first author, year. Later calls with `--out` append to both files and keep them in sync;
   a second paper under a key already taken gets a letter suffix (`Smith2020a`), which the output
   lists — cite the key it prints.
4. Check the failed list — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

`references.bib` and `references.json` are written ONLY by this script. Never write, paste or edit a
BibTeX entry by hand, and never edit `references.json`: the paper step checks every `\cite` key
against `references.bib` and every entry against its record, and an entry the script did not write
blocks the paper from being published.

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract its DOI or ArXiv ID and exact title
3. Retry the script with that DOI / ArXiv ID / exact title (same `--out`)
4. Still not found → the paper is not cited. Remove the citation (and any claim that rests only on
   it); there is no hand-written fallback.

---

### CLI (how to build a bibliography)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --out ./references.bib --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--out, -o PATH` — merge the entries into PATH and record them in `references.json` beside it (always use it for a bibliography)
`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then run the script with that `.venv`'s python (it falls back to the local core when the server is unreachable), `--out` included — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

### [7] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-24 00:35:56 UTC

```
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user (an automated AI research pipeline step) needs to write/append an internal research report for iteration 2 of a study investigating gold-free faithfulness metrics for NL-to-FOL (natural language to first-order logic) translation. The specific task is GEN_REPORT_TEXT (Step 3.4) which must:
   - Carry forward the previous report (`<previous_report>`) verbatim with only marked factual corrections
   - Append iteration 2's section covering 3 new artifacts (art_TaxJRnPcJMuZ, art_zcwCQgTqk6DN, art_HepAw8c6Eu7-)
   - Address all 9 MAJOR MUST-FIX and 4 MINOR reviewer feedback items
   - Write the full report to `./paper_draft.md`
   - Output structured JSON to `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` matching a specific schema
   - Also write `.aii/manifest.yaml` and `README.md`
   - Follow specific writing style rules (no selling, chronological, complete tables, dead ends kept)
   - Include [FIGURE:fig_id] markers with figure specs
   - Include [ARTIFACT:id] markers for provenance
   - Follow todos 1-7 exactly as written

   Workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_u75jRHUss0zo/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_report_text/gen_report_text`
   All files MUST be written inside this workspace directory.
   OpenRouter key must NOT be printed or saved.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - NL-FOL (natural language to first-order logic) translation/autoformalization
   - Gold-free faithfulness metrics (no reference formula needed)
   - FOL-Triage: 3-layer checker (L1 lint, L2 text accounting, L3 role questionnaire)
   - PEER+TEXT fusion: combining cross-family consensus (PEER) with text-based checks (TEXT)
   - Cross-system consensus (c_score = 1 - eq_frac)
   - Name-free alignment (structural matching without predicate names)
   - Graded clause consensus (g_score: support/coverage over claim units)
   - z3 SMT solver for logical equivalence checking
   - AUROC/AUPRC meta-evaluation metrics
   - Label regimes: R_AB (tiers A+B), R_A (tier A), R_SOLVER, R_ADJ
   - Typed repair operators: NEG, REV, QUANT, RESTR, CONN, MOVE, DROP, ADD, SWAP, BIND, SCOPE, UNGLUE
   - Meaning-preserving rewrites: RENAME, REORDER, DEMORGAN, CONTRAPOSITIVE
   - Contamination testing via nonce-disguised sentences
   - Sentence-clustered bootstrap for confidence intervals
   - FOLIO, MALLS datasets for NL-FOL benchmarking
   - R_COMP: composed long sentences with trusted references
   - PERTURB: typed perturbation suite with controls

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-paper-writing/REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`
     - Mandatory revision checklist to apply after writing the draft

     - Style note: "short declarative sentences interleaved with longer compound ones. Hedging is sparse. First person is 'we'. Numbers stated directly. Citation density high."
     - Section outlines for publishable paper structure

   - `domain_terms.json` (in workspace, already exists)
     - 97 domain vocabulary terms with glosses
     - Covers FOL metrics terminology, error types, datasets, evaluation concepts

       - All rows z3-verified (0 failures)
       - Cost: $0.41 total (only lexicon extraction ran)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - No code errors encountered yet as we are still in the data-gathering phase
   - The key constraint discovered: OpenRouter key exhaustion affected multiple artifacts (Experiment 5 couldn't run flash-lite judge on E; Dataset 3 couldn't generate R_COMP candidates)

5. Problem Solving:
   - Loaded 3 required skills successfully
   - Found that style_exemplars.md and domain_terms.json already exist from previous iteration (skipped regeneration)
   - Read extensive artifact output data across all 3 new iteration-2 artifacts
   - Identified key numbers needed for the report from artifact outputs
   - Was about to fetch BibTeX for new references (SAC3 by Zhang et al. 2023, FormalAlign ICLR 2025) when summarization was triggered

6. All user messages:
   - The single user message is an extremely large prompt containing:
     - System-level instructions for the AI Inventor pipeline
     - The previous report text (iteration 1 covering experiments A, C, D and dataset E)
     - Reviewer feedback with 9 MAJOR MUST-FIX and 4 MINOR items
     - Pipeline steps information (strategy, planning, execution)
     - The updated hypothesis for iteration 2
     - All 7 artifact summaries
     - 3 new artifacts this iteration
     - Detailed task instructions for what to write
     - Figure generation instructions
     - 7 specific TODOs to follow
     - The user's original research request about NL→FOL evaluation metrics
   - Security constraints from the prompt: "Do not print or save the [OpenRouter] key"; workspace path restriction; process isolation rules

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Task 2 (IN PROGRESS)**: Literature review - Need to search for and fetch BibTeX for SAC3 (Zhang et al. EMNLP Findings 2023, arXiv 2311.01740), FormalAlign (ICLR 2025), and any other references needed for the iteration 2 section. Write updated references.bib.
   - **Task 4 (IN PROGRESS)**: Read artifact outputs - Most key data has been read, but may need additional tables from evaluation artifact (e.g., mustfix tables, P1/P2 tables, complexity tables)
   - **Task 5 (PENDING)**: Write the full report - Carry forward previous report, apply reviewer corrections in place, write iteration 2 section with all tables from artifacts, update closing section, write to paper_draft.md
   - **Task 6 (PENDING)**: Append pass and terminology sweep - Verify nothing rewritten, all tables present, dead ends kept, reasoning recorded, sweep terminology against domain_terms.json
   - **Task 7 (PENDING)**: Emit structured JSON - Write .terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json with title, abstract, figures, summary, out_expected_files. Also write .aii/manifest.yaml and README.md.

8. Current Work:
   Was in the middle of Task 2 (literature review) and Task 4 (reading artifacts). Had just loaded the WebSearch tool schema to search for new references needed for iteration 2:
   - SAC3 (Zhang et al., EMNLP Findings 2023, arXiv 2311.01740) - reviewer says consensus > SC confirms this, not novel
   - FormalAlign (ICLR 2025) - reviewer says it's a gold-free alignment scorer for autoformalization, uncited
   
   All artifact data has been read from the three new artifacts. The key findings are:
   - PEER+TEXT achieves AUROC 0.790 on held-out E (R_AB), beating local judge by +0.078 [0.043,0.112]
   - But flash-lite judge bar is UNTESTABLE (OpenRouter outage)
   - Fusion does NOT beat c_score_align alone (stratified +0.011 n.s.)
   - Name-free alignment failed screen gate (threshold-tie artefact; post-hoc passes)
   - Mechanism predictions: P1 INCONCLUSIVE, P2 REFUTED, P3 INCONCLUSIVE, P4 REFUTED
   - R_COMP dataset incomplete (only perturbation suite is ready)
   - Re-evaluation confirms all 57/57 reviewer audit numbers
   - Label regime shifts confirmed: bow/fused go UP, c_score goes DOWN when switching solver→adj_AB labels

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue with Task 2: Fetch BibTeX entries for SAC3 and FormalAlign references, then proceed to write references.bib in the workspace. After that, begin Task 5: writing the full paper_draft.md with the iteration 2 section appended.
   
   The immediate next action was searching for SAC3 and FormalAlign papers to add to the bibliography, as the reviewer MINOR item states: "The report's one positive, non-obvious claim (cross-family consensus beats sampling self-consistency by +0.14) is not compared with its nearest published neighbours. SAC3 (Zhang et al., EMNLP Findings 2023, arXiv 2311.01740)... FormalAlign (ICLR 2025)..."

Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

   - **Evaluation artifact path wrong**: Initially tried `gen_art_eval_1` but correct path was `gen_art_evaluation_1`. Found via `find` command on directory structure.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully located all 3 new iteration-2 artifacts and read their key output files
   - Resolved bibliography gaps by adding SAC3 and FormalAlign references (reviewer MINOR item)

Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with 'I'll continue' or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened."
   - The original user message (from the compacted conversation) was an extremely large automated pipeline prompt containing the previous report, reviewer feedback (9 MAJOR, 4 MINOR), all artifact summaries, and detailed task instructions.
   - Security constraint (verbatim from CLAUDE.md): "Do not print or save the key" (referring to the OpenRouter API key).

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Task 5 (IN PROGRESS)**: Write the full report - Carry forward previous report verbatim, apply reviewer corrections in place, write iteration 2 section with all tables from artifacts, update closing section, write to paper_draft.md
   - **Task 6 (PENDING)**: Append pass and terminology sweep - Verify nothing rewritten, all tables present, dead ends kept, reasoning recorded, sweep terminology against domain_terms.json
   - **Task 7 (PENDING)**: Emit structured JSON - Write .terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json with title, abstract, figures, summary, out_expected_files. Also write .aii/manifest.yaml and README.md

8. Current Work:
   All data gathering is complete. The references.bib has been written with 18 entries (16 from iter 1 + SAC3 + FormalAlign). Tasks 1-4 are marked completed. Task 5 is in progress. The immediate next action is to write `paper_draft.md` containing:
   - The full iteration 1 report carried forward verbatim (with only marked factual corrections addressing reviewer MUST-FIX items)
   - A new Iteration 2 section covering:
     - Experiment 5: PEER+TEXT on held-out E (art_TaxJRnPcJMuZ) - AUROC 0.790, +0.078 vs local judge
     - Experiment 6: Baselines on E (referenced from experiment 5 context) - S4 0.754, local judge 0.710
     - Evaluation 1: Regime matrix, rederivation audit, flipped items, frontier judge gap (art_HepAw8c6Eu7-)
     - Dataset 3: R_COMP templates + PERTURB suite (art_zcwCQgTqk6DN)
     - Updated Related Work citing SAC3 [17] and FormalAlign [18]
     - All mechanism predictions (P1-P4)
     - Dead ends: name-free alignment failure, flash-lite untestable, R_COMP incomplete
   - [FIGURE:] and [ARTIFACT:] markers throughout
   - Updated references [1]-[18]
   
   After writing paper_draft.md, the revision checklist must be applied, then the structured JSON output emitted.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Write the full `paper_draft.md` file to the workspace directory. This is the core deliverable (Task 5). The file must carry forward the previous 446-line iteration 1 report and append the iteration 2 section with all the data gathered from the three artifacts. The previous summary stated: "Continue with Task 2: Fetch BibTeX entries for SAC3 and FormalAlign references, then proceed to write references.bib in the workspace. After that, begin Task 5: writing the full paper_draft.md with the iteration 2 section appended." Task 2 is now complete and references.bib is written, so the next step is writing paper_draft.md (Task 5).

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /root/.claude/projects/-ai-inventor-aii-data-runs-run-u75jRHUss0zo-3-invention-loop-iter-2-gen-report-text-gen-report-text/4b18f567-2f4b-425f-9a7f-219a367e14ce.jsonl
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

Attempt 1 failed validation.

Schema validation found 1 problem — fix ALL of them at once:
  - at `out_expected_files`: ['paper_draft.md', 'references.bib', 'domain_terms.json', 'style_exemplars.md', '.aii/manifest.yaml', 'README.md', '.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json'] is not of type 'object'
Every required field must be present and every field type must match the schema.

Produce `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` again so it contains corrected JSON that matches the schema. Do not invent new fields.
</validation-feedback>

STOP. You ended without submitting your report.

Do NOT search, fetch, or run anything else. Using ONLY the work you have already done:
1. Make sure the full report text is saved to `./paper_draft.md` in your workspace (exactly that name).
2. Submit the report via StructuredOutput now: title, abstract, figures, summary, and out_expected_files naming paper_draft.md. Where your instructions name a JSON output file instead of that tool, write the submission to that file. This must be your final action.

<style_check>
The draft was measured against the <writing_register> in your prompt and trips it:

- 20.2 em dashes per 1,000 words; the limit is 3. Replace them with commas, colons or full stops.

Revise the PROSE of the draft in `./paper_draft.md` to fix each point, then emit the structured output again. Numbers, claims, citations, [FIGURE:...] markers and [ARTIFACT:...] markers stay exactly as they are; do not add content and do not change results. The figures array is unchanged.

<CRITICAL_ERROR>
The module-end file check FAILED (attempt 1/3).

PROBLEMS:
  - .aii/manifest.yaml entry 1: 'paper_draft.md' has neither a 'keep:' nor a 'delete:' decision
  - .aii/manifest.yaml entry 2: 'references.bib' has neither a 'keep:' nor a 'delete:' decision
  - .aii/manifest.yaml entry 3: 'domain_terms.json' has neither a 'keep:' nor a 'delete:' decision
  - .aii/manifest.yaml entry 4: 'style_exemplars.md' has neither a 'keep:' nor a 'delete:' decision
  - .aii/manifest.yaml entry 5: '.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json' has neither a 'keep:' nor a 'delete:' decision
  - .aii/manifest.yaml entry 6: 'README.md' has neither a 'keep:' nor a 'delete:' decision

FIX IT:
1. Add one entry per uncovered path to `.aii/manifest.yaml` (create it if missing).
   Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve inside it. Globs and
   whole directories are fine — a whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry.

   entries:
     - path: results/
       keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible in this run
     - path: hf_cache/
       delete: redownloadable
       source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
     - path: checkpoints/
       delete: regenerable
       source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3"

   `keep:` takes a one-line reason. `delete:` takes `redownloadable` or
   `regenerable` and a `source:` that brings the files back.
2. Make sure `README.md` reads like a GitHub repository README: what you did,
   the layout (a line per important file/dir), how to run it, and a
   "Restoring removed files" section with the command for EVERY delete entry.
3. Text and code files never need a decision, and neither does anything under
   the auto-keep floor. Only large binaries and cache directories do.
