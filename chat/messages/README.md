Complete, auto-generated transcript of **the full conversation every agent had** across this run — system & user prompts, assistant responses, thinking blocks, and every tool call with its result — generated at repository-upload time so it captures all steps. For an inputs-only view (just the prompts) see the sibling `../prompts/` folder.

- Run: `gen_paper_repo_a2e1d024cc16` — Gold-Free Faithfulness Metrics for NL-to-FOL Translation

Each turn is labelled by role and timestamped, with its full untruncated body:

- **SYSTEM PROMPT / SYSTEM-USER / HUMAN-USER** — the instructions and prompts fed in.
- **ASSISTANT** — the model's response text.
- **THINKING** — the model's reasoning blocks.
- **TOOL CALL — `<tool>`** — a tool invocation with its input.
- **TOOL RESULT — `<tool>`** — the tool's output (marked `[ERROR]` on failure).
- **CONFIG / HOOK / RETRY** — the session config snapshot, injected hook reminders, and retry-attempt boundaries.

Parsed identically for both agent backends (`terminal_claude` and `sdk_openhands`), which normalise into one event schema. Pure telemetry (token-usage ticks, cost rollups, lifecycle markers, pipeline status lines) is excluded.

Layout mirrors the run's module tree (same as `../prompts/`): one folder per high-level phase, a `round_N/` per iteration where the phase iterates, then each module — a single-task module is one `.md` file, a parallel module (gen_plan / gen_art / gen_viz / gen_demo_art) is a folder with one `.md` per task.
